"When you think of a podcast script, you might think of a play or movie script—where every word is planned out in advance. You might be hesitant to adopt a script for this reason; won’t scripting your podcast essentially rob it of its casual, free-flowing, and conversational feel? Won’t reading off of a page make you sound stilted and monotone? Not necessarily. For one thing, a podcast script doesn’t need to be a word-for-word transcript of your show. Podcast scripts, unlike stage or television scripts, can run the gambit from bare-bones to detailed, as long as they give you an outline and general idea of what should take place in your audio recording. A podcast script is basically a roadmap for your episode—and you can decide how many details you need to make it from point A to Z. A well-done script gives structure, direction, and conciseness to your podcast episode. Having an outline and a written direction for your show can help you feel more at ease and focus on the here and now, rather than being stressed about how you’re going to fill the next 30-45 minutes of recording time. So let's get to writing the script for our next episode. How are we going to start?",7.7,I ’ ll start with the outline and the outline.,7.59,I ’ m not sure that I want to leave the stage.

"At my workplace, there was a story about a new employee named Sarah. Sarah was hired to work in the customer service department, but she had no experience in this field. At first, Sarah struggled with the job. She had a hard time dealing with angry customers and solving their problems. She often made mistakes and felt overwhelmed. But Sarah didn't give up.

"There are, indeed, only two possible outcomes: either a surgical, precise hit, or a ridiculous, laughable miss. However, based on my observations, I believe the chances of the second option turning out to be true are fairly low, dare I say are negligible, if not absolutely nil. You affirm that you have a romantic companion who identifies as a man, am I correct? Well, in that case, I could safely place a bet on the fact that he doesn't so often, if at all perform mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-cheek contact for recreational purposes with you. If such a bet was placed, I would most certainly win it. Overly loud and exaggerated noises of the kind of physical contact I described before. I can also affirm with a good certainty that this said ""boyfriend"" shall, in the future, cease his current search for anorther romantic companion other than you. When such a thing happens, he will settle with her, abandoning you. He is also not going to miss you a bit. I also predict that he will do the so-called ""skrrt"", which is no more than the sound of a vehicle's engine and tires running at full throttle, but still before such vehicle catches momentum. He is, finally, going to perform the head and arms movement popularly known as ""dab"", in the exact precise ways that the DJ known as ""Wiz Khalifa"" so often does that it became a personal trait.

"Cooking a steak is something that every man should know how to do. It's a simple and quite delicious meal, and it doesn't take too much time at all to make. To make the perfect steak, you start off by salting the steak in advance and placing it in the fridge for at least an hour. The thicker the steak the longer it should be in the fridge. This is done so the excess moisture can seep out of the steak. Afterwards I personally like adding garlic powder, and a bit of oil on the steak so that the seasoning sticks to it. Make sure the pan is nice and hot before adding the steak in and just let it rest on its side for a minute or so to caramelize before flipping it over to the other side. If the steak is nice and thick you can then place it in the oven until the internal temperature is around 135 degrees to give it a nice medium rare. After that, you place it back into the pan and add rosemary and garlic before adding butter. Before the it starts burning you should baste the steak with the liquified butter to infuse some flavour into it. Once you finish basting, let the steak rest so that the external temperature of the steak reaches around 130 (it should take around 10 minutes), which allows the juices from the center of the steak to spread out and cover the entire cross section of it, and since it is not concentrated in the center, the juices won't flow out of the steak when it is cut.",7.3,I see.,0.1,How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue?,0.45
"The Messi versus Ronaldo debate is one that is seemingly timeless, having gone on for as long as I can remember, and one that surely will go on far beyond the retirement of both players. It is a conflict between two undoubtedly generational talents, far above (in terms of numbers) any other players we have seen in the past ten years, a fact all the more impressive due to the age of the two superstars- Messi is now 32, while Ronaldo is 35. The debate is also fueled by the fact that the players have become almost exact opposites, skill versus physique, teamwork or individuality, one-club man as opposed to glory hunter, facts that simply compel people to take sides. Their brilliance is proven by the insane numbers that the two players have recorded across their careers, even in this most disrupted of seasons. Across his career, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 725 goals, and provided 220 assists in 1,000 appearances. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, has 697 goals, and 289 assists in 718 matches. The goals and assists records of these players alone is outstanding; combined with the sheer number of appearances that the two have made, which most players get nowhere near in their careers, it is hard to dispute the pair’s otherworldliness, in that they have proved their brilliance on such a consistent basis, largely untroubled by serious injury. It is truly a challenge to definitively say who is better, however, given the stats previously mentioned, which would you say is the better player based solely on the statistics?",9.94,I see.,0.1,"I think, as you know, the only person who has ever won a unanimous decision in the Ballon d'Or, the Ballon d'Or who had the most goals in the Ballon d'Or who, although, to be the best in every aspect of the Ballon d'Or who, he did not give a place to the ballon, to the ballon.",8.49
"Playing top lane in League of Legends can be pretty complex, it’s often considered an island by the community as it is generally secluded compared to the other 2 lanes. Because of this, the best top laners must perfect their mechanics and decision making to best their opponents. There are a handful of meta champions for which most top laners must learn the matchups to. Some of the most important concepts to learn in top lane are wave management and back timers. The most common wave management techniques they will encounter being a freeze and a 3 wave push. A freeze is where you keep at least 4 enemy minions outside your tower range but within your half of the lane and only proceed to last hit them in order to prevent the wave from crashing into your tower or pushing to the enemy’s side of the lane. This makes the opponent susceptible to ganks. The 3 wave push is relatively simple, it forces a large wave to crash into the enemy tower by slowly building a minion advantage for the first 2 waves, and proceeding to hard push the 3rd wave, resulting in a crash which will then also bounce the next wave back towards your side of the lane, allowing for a freeze setup. I am not however very familiar with mid lane as I do not play it much. Would you be able to tell me the most important parts of mid lane?",8.26,I can tell you the basics.,6.57,"The most important thing is that you can move around while you ’ re not in a position to do anything.

This means that I was looking at laptops under 17 inches, with a decent battery life, powerful GPU and CPU, at least 16GB of RAM, and preferably 1TB of storage. When searching the market, I stumbled upon this laptop which satisfied my list, as well as had the latest processor and GPU at the time, as well as a high resolution screen to top it off.

"Planning a wedding can be chaotic. There are a few steps which can help with the process however. The first thing you should do when planning your wedding is to determine how much you can afford to spend. This will help you make decisions about other aspects of the wedding, such as the venue, the number of guests, and the type of food and drinks you will serve. Once you have a budget in place, the next step is to choose a date for your wedding. Keep in mind that some venues and vendors may be booked up months in advance, so it's important to start planning early. Consider factors like the season, the availability of your desired venue, and the schedules of your friends and family members when deciding on a date. The venue is one of the most important aspects of your wedding, as it will set the tone for the entire event. Consider factors like the size of the space, the availability of on-site catering and other services, and the location when choosing a venue. Be sure to visit the venue in person and take a tour before making a decision. All that’s left is choosing a theme, planning the small details (food, drinks, etc.), and inviting the guests.

"A car is a vehicle that is used for transportation. It has four wheels and an engine that powers it. The engine burns fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to create energy. This energy is used to turn the wheels and move the car forward. Inside the car, there is a steering wheel that you use to control the direction of the car. There are also pedals that you use to accelerate, brake, and change gears. The accelerator pedal makes the car go faster, the brake pedal slows the car down, and the gear shift lets you change between different gears to adjust the speed of the car. The car also has other systems that help it work properly. For example, the suspension system helps the car ride smoothly over rough roads, and the cooling system helps keep the engine from overheating. To start the car, you turn the key in the ignition and press the accelerator pedal. The engine will start and the car will be ready to drive. To stop the car, you press the brake pedal and put the car in park. I’m sure you already knew most of this stuff, but I hope you managed to learn something new at least.

"As the coach, it's my job to prepare my team for the game and help them execute a winning strategy. I comprised a plan for the game coming up that we are going to follow. Before the game I would review footage of the opponent's previous games and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This will help me identify their top players, their preferred formations and tactics, and any areas where they may be vulnerable. Based on my analysis of the opponent, I would develop a game plan that takes advantage of their weaknesses and minimizes their strengths. In the days leading up to the game, I would hold practices and drills to prepare the team for the game. During the game, I would closely monitor the action on the field and make adjustments to our game plan as needed. I would communicate with the players constantly, providing them with instructions, encouragement, and feedback. After the game, I would review the performance of the team and the individual players.

"Climate change is a major global problem that is affecting the Earth's environment and the lives of people around the world. It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and raise the temperature of the Earth's surface, leading to a range of negative impacts. One of the most visible effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius over the last century, and it is projected to continue rising in the future. This warming is causing changes in weather patterns, such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms. Another impact of climate change is the melting of glaciers and ice caps. As the Earth's temperature rises, ice is melting at an alarming rate, leading to rising sea levels and increased flooding in coastal areas. This is a major threat to the millions of people who live near the ocean, as well as to wildlife and ecosystems. Now I ask you, what are you doing in order to combat climate change and make a difference to our world?",9.3,I'm not quite sure.

"Hitler was born in Austria in 1889 and grew up in a poor family. He showed an early interest in politics and became involved with the German Workers' Party, which would later become the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to overthrow the German government in a failed coup attempt known as the Beer Hall Putsch. He was arrested and imprisoned, but used the time to write his political autobiography, ""Mein Kampf."" After his release from prison, Hitler re-entered politics and gained a following by promising to restore Germany to greatness and to rid the country of its enemies. He used propaganda, speeches, and violence to gain power and suppress opposition. In 1933, he became Chancellor of Germany, and in 1934, after the death of President Hindenburg, he declared himself Führer (leader) of Germany. As leader of Germany, Hitler implemented policies that were discriminatory, oppressive, and genocidal. He sought to create a ""pure"" Aryan race by eliminating Jews, homosexuals, disabled people, and other groups he considered undesirable. He implemented the Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of their citizenship and rights, and began the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of six million Jews and millions of others.

The “premium” urns were metal or stone with the option of touches like paw prints or a comforting saying inscribed on them. Of course the nice urns were all an extra $150-200 on top of the $1000 I was already paying for euthanasia and cremation.

After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. Do you think it was selfish of me?",7.06,"Yes, I do. I think so.My parents want me to learn to be a better singer. I think it's important that I learn how to sing.",0.93,"Not at all.The couple that I was with did not have a choice, and I didn't want to see them kill me. I simply wanted my parents to be with me. I was their only real companion. ",0.5
"There’s a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to an AI system. When you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, you don’t mean this should be their life’s mission, and nothing else in the universe matters. Even if they have to kill everybody else in Starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes— they should do that. No, that’s not what you mean. All the other things that we mutually care about, they should factor into your behavior as well. And the problem with the way we build AI systems now is we give them a fixed objective. The algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective. And if you say, can we fix the acidification of the oceans? Yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently, but it consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere, which would apparently cause us to die fairly slowly and unpleasantly over the course of several hours. How should design an artificial intelligent system that doesn't have a fixed objective?",8.03,I think you ’ re right. I ’ m probably right. I just think it ’ s too complicated for some people to understand.,8.5,I think you ’ re right. ,10.2
"Social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere with the life you want to live. And this happens when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data points on which to reject you. So if you have friends who have trouble socializing, how should we reach out and help them?",7.66,I see.,0.1,I think I have a similar problem. I was turned down for my acceptance of a job I had just as a joke. I was a joke and now I'm a reality TV star.,5.79
"It's easy to tell when someone's not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found that good listening is one of the most important things we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one conversation is about taking an interest in another person and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply go through the motions— researchers have found that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly performative about listening in that it’s important to show you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions and body language that indicate their understanding and their desire to understand. Are there any other tips to help us become better listeners?",9.4,I think you ’ re right. I think it ’ s important to be able to tell whether or not that we can make good friends.,7.52,Yes. We can rely on our natural ear to tell when to tell whether we are right or not. ,7.16
