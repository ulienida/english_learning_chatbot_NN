There's just nothing can please her . , No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . , It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . , My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . , You said she used to ?

"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! , What ? What did you buy ? , It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! , What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? , There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . , And ? , So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . , And it's a brick ? , Yes . , I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? , I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . , So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . , Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . , But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? , He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . , Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! , C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . , That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . , You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
"Is the clock right ? , I'm afraid it gains a little . , By how many minutes ? , Two . "

And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . , It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? , There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . , Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . , I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . , Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . "

"It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . , I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . , How come you think of him that way ? , Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . , I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . , Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? , Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . , All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . "

You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . , But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter .

All this makes me feel like an idiot . , Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet .

I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . "

Who interviewed you ? , My boss . , What kinds of questions did she ask you ? , She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . , The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? , I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . , Those are good answers . How did she react ? , She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . , What do you think about her as a boss ? , She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . , You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! , That's true .

"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! , What ? What did you buy ? , It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! , What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? , There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . , And ? , So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . , And it's a brick ? , Yes . , I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? , I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . , So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . , Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . , But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? , He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . , Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! , C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . , That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . , You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
"I'm sorry for being late . , You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over . , About what time can I go to my own class ? , When everything is over . , Now that it is all over . can I go now ? , Not yet .

Do you think we are boring people ? , I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . , That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? , That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . , I like to play the piano for fun . , Yeah . That can be a good hobby . , Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . , That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . "

What would you do with all that spare time ? , As I said , I'd go round the world . , What would you do after that ? , Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . , It doesn't sound very exciting . , Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? , I'd be happy if I got a rise . , And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . , Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . , What'll you have ? , I'll have a pint of the best . , I'd have a Scotch if I were you .

"Do you think children watch too much Tv ? , I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . , Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . , If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . , They could go out and play with their friends . , Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . , Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . , That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . "

It is always crowded with many people . , why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . , Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . , They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . , I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . , Me too .

They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . , I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? , Anything you want .

Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! , Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . , I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . , That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . , Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . , I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . , We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . , Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? , I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . , Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? , I hope not .

Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? , Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . , Cool ! Teach me ! , For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . , Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . , That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . "
"Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? , Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us .

Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! , Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . , But ... But ... , But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . , Maybe you are right . "

I get nervous when I talk to girls . , Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . , What do I talk about ? , It doesn't matter .

"It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . , Would you like to live in the country ?

The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . , What do you mean ? , Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . , I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . , People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . , I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . , I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . , The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . , Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . , You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! "

How about you ? , to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . , what's wrong ? , well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . , that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . , the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . , I see how that can get a bit annoying . , a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . , so what are you going to do about it ? , I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . , what do you think would make you happier ? , in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . , relationships can be confusing sometimes . , what would you do if you were me ? , I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! "

But on Saturday there's a football final . , Then , what shall we do on Sunday . , Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time . , Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . , OK . "

They know what's best for you . , But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . , But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . , Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . , And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . , You're right . Thank you for the advice . "

Don't think for a second that I trust you . "
"I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . , Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? , No problem . , Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . , I will . "

"How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? , Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . , I never eat breakfast though . , That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . , I never thought about it that way . , I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . , Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . , Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . , I know doctor , thank you so much .

Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . , I thought you didn't talk to them much . , I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . , What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? , Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . , Maybe you should think about moving . , I can't afford to move right now . , Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . , I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . , Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? "

In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . , What about me ? I ’ m your friend . , I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . , I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? , Not at all . , I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . , That ’ s a good idea . , What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? , I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . , People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . , That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! "

"I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? , Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . , I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? , Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . , You mean you didn't know much English then ? , Right . I only knew a few English sentences . , That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? , First , I worked as a servant . , Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . , I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . "
"Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? , Sure , what's up ? , I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? , Good question . I have to think about it . , My husband is betting on France . , France ? Is he crazy ? , What do you mean ? , Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . "
"Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? , I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . , I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? , I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . , I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? , Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . , All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? , Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . , I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . , Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? , Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? , Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . , I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? , Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . , No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . , I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . "

It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . , Two months ? How did you find out ? , I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . , So you asked him about the girl who called ? , Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . , What'd he do ? , He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . "

Besides we can go to the beach anytime . , thanks for understanding . , well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? , hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . , Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . , I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . , maybe ... I'll think about it . "
"Hello , Jill . , Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? , Fine , only a little tired . , You'll recover after a good night's sleep . , Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . , That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? , Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . , Don't mention it . , The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful .

It's really important to get a lot of rest . , Yeah , you're right . , And have you taken anything for it ? , No , I haven't . , Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! , Ugh ! "
"I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . , That's okay . I can explain a little . , I don't want to lose all my money . , Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . , I guess you're right . , Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? , Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . , That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . , I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . , But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . , Okay . , So how much do you want to gamble ? , Maybe 500 dollars . , 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? , I don't want people to think I'm stingy . , That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . "

We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a , it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? , there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h , well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . , I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . , yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . "

We've been drifting apart for a while . , but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . , we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . , can't you hang out with them , too ? , I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . , maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . , I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . , it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . , you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . , she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . , I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . , I still think you two should try to patch things up . , I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . "
"Do you like flowers ? , Of course , I like flowers . , What's your favorite flower ? , I like peach blossom , because I like spring . , Peach blossom is really beautiful . , Yes . How about you ? , I like lotus . , You have a perfect taste ! , But there aren't any lotus now . , Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . , That's not bad . Let's go . "

"Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? , I think a mountain village is splendid ! , I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . , It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . , I disagree , a big town is more lively . , But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! , Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . "
"It's getting late , and I have to go now . , We're sorry you have to leave . , Please excuse me , won't you ? , Certainly . Come back soon . "
"what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? , to be honest , I wouldn't . , why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? , not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . , what's the puzzle ? , my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . , oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . , yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . , oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . , but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . , definitely . , you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . , don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . , I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . , sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . "
"I've had enough of that ! , Why , this is the most interesting film ! , I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . , But it's only a film . "
"How much did you bid ? , Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! , We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! , But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . , What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? , You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . "
"It's taking you forever to do my hair . , Give me a minute . , You should've been done already . , There you go . , I don't think that you're done . , What's wrong ? , My hair looks hideous . , What's so bad about it ? , It doesn't look good at all . , Sorry about that . , I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . , Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? "
"Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! , Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . , Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! , Madam , patience is a virtue . , Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! , I'm sure a spot will open up soon . , Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? "
"What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! , I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . , I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! , I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? , I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . , Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? , I don't know . , I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . , What do you mean ? , We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . , I have plenty of gas . , Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . , So what can we do ? , Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . , Alright . That's a good idea . , I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . , Days ? , Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . , Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . , Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . , Okay , I'll follow your advice . "
"let's go out for a walk . , I don't really feel like a walk . , Well , shall we go to the cinema ? , All right.That sounds more interesting . "
"Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? , The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . , Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . , Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . , But this chance is really precious . , Well , I know . So I am thinking now . , I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . , Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . "
"Hurry up . We're going to be late . , I am hurrying . , What are you doing ? , I can't figure out which dress to wear . "
"Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? , Which one will you be going to ? , We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . , Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . , I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . , OK , can I bring a date with me ? , Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . , Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . , Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . , I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? , Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? , I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . , I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . , One last question.Is there a dress code there ? , No , its very casual there .

I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? , But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . , I got two . We can go there together . , Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . "
"You look great ! , Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . , So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . , I surely am . But still there is one single problem . , What's that ? , I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . , It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? , I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? , More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? , Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? , Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . , I can so that . , Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . , How did it go ? , Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . "

"Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? , Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? , He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish , Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? , School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . , Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? , No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . , What does he do when it rains ? , My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . "
"Are you an American ? , Yeah . , Why don't you speak English ? , Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . , Oh , do you like Chinese ? , Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . , I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? , Very Good . I'd like to do that . , When will we begin ? , How about tomorrow night ? , That's all right . "
"Lily , do you know Lizzy ? , Lizzy who ? , Lizzy smith . , Of course I do . , Then , Do you know her younger sister ? , You mean Mary ? , Yes . , Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary . , Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ? , Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too . , That sounds terrific . , Why do you ask me these questions ? , I just want to visit the family some day . "

But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . , What are you planning to do today ? , I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . , Have you done windsurfing before ? , No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . , Can you take a little advice from a friend ? , Sure . What ? , Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . , But I always wanted to try it . , Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . , Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? "
"I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! , Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . , It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . , But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . , That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . , Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? , I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . , Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? , Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . , Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . , That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . , If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . , I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! "
"Excuse me , I need your assistance . , Sure , what's up ? , I have no idea where my class is . , Tell me which building it's in . , My class is in the C building . , I know where the C building is . , Do you mind telling me where it is ? , Of course , which room number is it ? , Number 261 . , I actually have a class right around there . , Can you please show me ? , I can do that . "
"So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? , Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . , That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? , I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? , I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . , You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? , Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . , Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . , My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . , I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . "
"Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? , Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . , Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . , But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! , Why can't we ? , It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? , I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . , But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! , I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . , Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! , Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . , That's better . "
"I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . , I know what you mean . , Really ? , Yes , he did the same to me . "
"Excuse me , Supen . , I hope nothing is wrong . , Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... , What's the matter ? , My daughter isn't feeling well . , Oh , no . Is it serious ? , I don't know . Will you forgive me ? , Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . , Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . , Not at all . "
"Hello . Can I help you ? , Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . , I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . , I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . , That's because it's full . , But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . , Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? , My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . , Alright . And what is your major ? , I'm a comparative literature major . , Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? , Yes , that's right . , Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . , That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . , The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . , Even if the class is full ? , That's right . , Oh , I didn't know that . , Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . , Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? , Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . , Thanks . , Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . "
"Who's that man over there talking to James ? , Where ? Oh , that's Henry . , He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? , He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . , Really ? I love eccentric people . , Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . , Why ? What do you mean by that ? , Well , haven't you heard ? , Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . , Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . , Really ! How fascinating . , According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . , Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . , Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . "
"Where are you from ? , I'm from Germany . , So you speak German , don't you ? , Yeah , but I can speak English , too . , Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? , A little French . , Good . "

"Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ? , Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? , I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian , maybe . , I know the perfect place ! , Good ! Where is it ? , It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? , That would be great . , Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! "
"Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . , Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . , Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . , I hope it's not gonna break into three digits , But it's already awfully close . , Well , I just hope it'll level off . , I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . , I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . "
"Hi , where have you been ? , I was away for my vacation . , Oh , how was it ? , Good . I wish I could have another vacation . "
"do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? , sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? , I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . , that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? , I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . , if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? , I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . , you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . , the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . , the Taj it is then . , shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? , they'll still charge us a corkage fee . , that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . , don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . , are you sure ? We could go Dutch . , no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . , I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! "
"Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ? , Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning . , And later ? , Well , in the afternoon , after a long nap , we ’ ll go yachting with Nora . , It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow . , How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? , I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.How I envy you , Robin ! "
"You married Joe , didn't you ? , Joe ? I don't know what you mean . , I remember you are in love . , Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . , It's Greek to me . "
"Hi . are you new here ? , Yes . I moved here last week . , I'm Steven , your neighbour . , I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . , Nice to meet you , too . , Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . , I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . , Thank you . I will . "
"The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . , This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? , Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything , No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . , Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . , Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . , I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? , I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . , They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... "
"Hi , Bob , this is Mary . , Hello , Mary , where do you work ? , I work for an Internet company . , Is the pay good ? "
"Hey Jack . What's going on ? , Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? , Really ? When did you decide this ? , I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . , That's exciting , man . , So how did you propose ? , You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . , What do you think I should do ? , There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . , I never thought about that . , Thought about what ? , Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? , I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . , I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . , Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . "
"What's this , I wonder ? , I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . , A coffee grinder ? , Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . , Oh , that would be very useful . "
"Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! , Yeah . How's everything going ? , Not bad . At least I am still alive . , Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . , Where did you get that idea ? , Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . , You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . , Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . "
"Here's your drink , sir . , No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . , Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . , Waiter ! , Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . , It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . , Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . , I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . , I'm really sorry . "
"Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? , I suppose I do . , The climate here is pleasant . , You said it . , This city is really comfortable to living . , It sure is . , No other city can match it .

"you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . , thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . , how did you meet each other ? , she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . , is this your first date ? , yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . , sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . , oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? , absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! , then who will you meet tonight ? , a guy I met on the internet three month ago . , really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? , please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . , I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . "

How is your wife doing ? , She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . , That's good to hear . , I'm just glad there were no complications . , If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? , It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . , That's normal for anyone with a newborn . , Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . , You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . , That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time . "

I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . , Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . , I will . "
"I like this kind of weather . , Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . , And it's calm . I like the peace . , Me , too . "

But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . , I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . , Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? , Yes . And what dances do you like best ? , Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . , Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . , My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . , Fine . "

"
"Have you seen this ? , What ? , They killed another hostage . , Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . , I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? , Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . , Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? , I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . , Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? , Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . , Really ? What happened ? , Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . , Oh , sure . "

I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . , Really , what makes you say that ? , Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? , Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . , Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? , Three . Two boys and a girl . "
"Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? , Yes , are you ? , I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . , You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . , It wasn't cold out this morning . , Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! , Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? , It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . , That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . , Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . , How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? , I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . , Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . , I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? , Good idea . That will help us to warm up . , If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . , Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . "
"Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? , Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . , I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . , I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? , Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? , I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . , Do we have Christmas pudding ? , Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone .

I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . "

"Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . , I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . , What makes you think so ? , She's my sister , you know . "
"What's the matter with you ? You don't look well . , Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad . , Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin . , Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid . , Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south . "
"If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . , Come off it . , You want a bet ? , Why not ? "
"Are you still busy today ? , It seems to be . How about you today ? , Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . , OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . , Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . "
"I've come to say good-bye . , When are you off ? , I'm flying home on Sunday afternoon . , Well , good-bye . See you soon . , Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me . "

"Who's that tall guy over there ? , Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . , What's he like normally ? , Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . , Really ? What kind of problems ? , Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . , Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . , Really ? What makes you say that ? , Well , he doesn't look very honest . , I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? , Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . , Oh , really ? , Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? , Yes , I'll have another cocktail . , Vodka martini ? , Absolutely . , I'll be back in a sec . , OK . I'll wait here for you . "
"Hello . Is this Ann ? , Yes , it is . Kelly ? , Yes , it's me . , Do you have a cold ? , No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . , Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? , I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . , I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? , Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . , Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? , Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . , Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? , I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . , It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . , Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . , That bad , huh ? , Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever . , Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . , Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . , Hope you feel better . "

"Here , Let me get the door for you . , Thanks . , Do you need a hand with that ? , Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . , Don't worry about it . "
"You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? , No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . , Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? , No , thanks . I am okay . , You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... , Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . , Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? , I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . , You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . , I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . , I hope you will have second thoughts . "
"What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? , I enjoyed myself , too . , Shall I give you a ride home ? , Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . , It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . , That's great . Let's go ! "

"Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? , Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . , Thank you . , You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? , Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . , I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? , Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . , I am going there , too . We can walk together . , Sure . "
"We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? , This Friday evening ? , Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . , Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . , Good ! , What time should I arrive ? , How about 6:00 ? , Fine . See you then . "
"Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? , Well , do you think I have to ? , I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . , Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . , Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! , But I don't think it's so nice . , Why ? , The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . , Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . "
"Can you speak English ? , Yes I can . I speak it very well . , Where did you learn it ? , I lived in England when I was a child . , What else can you speak ? , Well , I know a little Italian . "
"What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? , Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . , Do we need to book a table in advance ? , No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . , What time shall we go ? , Why not now ? I'm hungry . "
"What is the movie you saw last night ? , It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . , How do you like it ? , I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . , But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . , Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . , My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . , What's it about ? , It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . , I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . , Let's go . The time is coming . , We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . "
"I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . , I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . , Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . , And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . "
"How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? , Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . , In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? , My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . , Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? , No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho , My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting , Of course there'll be a room for you ! , To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . , Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . , But four boys ! , It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . , You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . , It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? , That's a great idea ! , We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! , That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . "
"Hello , Kate . , Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? , I was almost on line the whole night . , Did you play network games the whole night ? , No , I listened to the music , too . , What are you going to do now ? , I'm tired . I need a rest . "
"I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? , Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . , Some other time then ? , OK.Thanks for asking me . "
"Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . , I'm glad I was able to help . , It's most kind of you . , Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . , If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . , Thank you . , I'm most grateful . , It was a pleasure . "
"what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? , I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! , but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? , they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . , so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? , sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . , how about drinking soda ? , many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try , that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? , my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . , how do you know so much about food and dieting ? , you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! "
"John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . , I don't mind at all . , All right . Are you married ? , To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . , Then , when do you plan to get married ? , I don't know . It's still up in the air . "
"What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? , I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? , I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . , Why not ? , Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how it goes . "
"hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . , that depends . What is it ? , it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans , I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . , if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . , let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . , thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . , that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? , how about at 6 pm ? , see you then ! "
"You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? , I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? , Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . , I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . "
"I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . , Why don't you run outside ? , Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? , Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . , No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . , Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . , You ? , Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . , I didn't know you could exercise . , What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! , Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . , No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . , You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! , Are you laughing at me ? , I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . , Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . , It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . , So I need to do something too . , But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . , I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? , It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... , What ? , I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . "
"The boss is mad at you . , Who cares ? "
"Bob , what are you thinking about ? , I'm looking forward to going to America . , When do you go ? , Next week . "
"I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! , There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? , Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . , Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? , No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? , I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . , I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . , I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . , I think that would be horrible ! , I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! "
"I'm going to America . , Any idea when you'll leave ? , I hope before the end of the month . , Let me know when you find out . "
"Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? , Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . , How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? , They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . , Do they have any grandchildren ? , Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . , Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ? , Yes , she gets along with them quite well . , Do they have a large family ? , Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . "
"Where do you live , Kim ? , I live in an apartment downtown . , Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ? , Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ? , . I have a house in the suburbs . , Oh , I bet it's really quiet . But is there much to do there ? , No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . , Hey . Let's trade places one weekend ! , OK . Great idea ! "
"I must be going now . , Really ? Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? , No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon . , Be seeing you then . , See you . "
"It's awfully hot . , You can say that again . "
"It seems a glorious day today . , I agree ... , It's beginning to spot . , Just now we both thought it would be fine . "
"I don't think I'm getting better . , Believe me , you really look much better than before . , I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . "
"did you get my email ? , I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? , sure . , how did the business trip go ? , well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . , I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! , I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! , our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . , I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . , I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . , thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! , no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? , no , should I have ? "
"Hello ! , Is that the box-office ? , Yes . , I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . , Just a minute please .

"

"How did you first meet ? , My roommate invited both of us to dinner . , Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? , Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . "
"Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers , Until when ? , Until Monday or Tuesday next week . , No problem . "
"Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? , Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . , You don't have to go right away . , I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . "
"Are you satisfied with the dishes ? , Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . , I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . , Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 , If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? , Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . , Great , I love hot food too . , Well , let's finish this great dinner first . , You said it . "
"Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? , Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . , No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . , Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? , My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... , I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . , Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . "

"What ? You golden watch is lost ? , Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . , It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . , Let's get it back . "
"Good morning , Miss . , Morning . Can I help you ? , Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . , All you need is your student identification card to check out books . "
"Do you have much experience with kids ? , Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . , To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . , I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . , What about your mother ? Did she help you ? , Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . , I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . , Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . , Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . , No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . "
"Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? , Two . French and Spanish . , And how well can you speak them ? , Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . , And how about your Spanish ? , Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . , I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . , In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . "
"We'd better leave now . , I beg your pardon ? "
"How is everything going with your girlfriend ? , Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! , Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? , It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! , Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? , No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! , What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? , I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . , I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! , I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . , I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? , I guess so . , So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! "
"Have we handed out all the water ? , Yes . So what else to do now ? , Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . , I see . How do you like the game ? , Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . , Who do you think do better ? , Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . , Exactly . He is unbelievable . , On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . , They were really tough . , The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . , I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . "
"Let's do something different today . , Like how ? , I would like you to give me a different hair style . , What did you have in mind ? , Give me a short haircut . , Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? , I want you to cut it to a few inches long . , That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? , I've had this idea for some time now . , I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . , This is what I want . , Fine then . Let's get started . "
"I am thinking about resigning from my current job . , Have you thought about it seriously ? , Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . , Ok , did you find a new company ? , Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . , Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . , Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . "
"Why do you want to go to the U . S . ? , I want to enrich my knowledge in management .

You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL . , Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ? , I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S . , How long do you expect to stay there ? , I will be there for three years . "
"Dear Anna . I really love you . , I love you , too . , I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? , Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? , Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... , No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . , Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . , I trust you . We'll be happy . , Let me wear you this diamond ring . , It's so beautiful . "
"We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? , I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . , Why not ? , I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . , Then would you like to have lunch with us ? , I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . , Would you like me to give you a lift ? , No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . , Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . , Ok , thank you . "
"Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? , Yes , are you ? , I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . , You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . , It wasn't cold out this morning . , Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! , Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . , Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? , It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . , That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . , Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . , How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? , I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . , Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . , I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? , Good idea . That will help us to warm up . , If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . , Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . "
"I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! , Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . , But it ’ s so old . , Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? , No , not at all . , First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . , I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? , It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . , Why does he want to do that ? , Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . , Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? , No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . , I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . , So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? , There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! , That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . , It would take a lot less time ... , How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . , Ok . That sounds like a deal . "
"Hello ! , Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . , Hi , Jason ! Long time no see .

It says , "" Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ...

I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . , I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . , I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . , I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . , I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . , I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . , Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . , Yeah , that's nice . , Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . , A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? , I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase .

"So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? , Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . , That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? , I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? , I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . , You mean they're kicking you out ? , Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . , Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . , My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . , I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . "
"I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . , Well , let's get together soon . , Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? , Sure . How about Monday ? , Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday .

Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . , Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . , So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? , Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? , You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late .

"So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? , Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . , And , is it what you found ? , Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . , You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . "

Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . , Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . , I know you're right , but what can I do ? , How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? , But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . , I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . , That's a good idea ! "

"Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? , No . What ? , He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . , No .

Where was I ? , He lost his wallet and keys . , Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . , Oh , no . , Yes .

I mean , where does drinking get you ? , It's fashionable . , Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . , Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . , How ? By drinking ? , Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . , When did you begin to drink ? , It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' , And then ? , Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . , So you get drunk every day ? "

Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? , no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently .

We've been drifting apart for a while . , But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . , We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . , Can't you hang out with them , too ? , I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . , Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . , I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . , It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . , You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . , She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . , I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . , I still think you two should try to patch things up . , I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . "

Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . , Heads . , Sorry , it's tails . You lose . , Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . , Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? , No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . , Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . , Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? , Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? , Yes , I agree . , So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . , Alright . , I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . , Is that right ? , Yes , that's right . , Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . , Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . , Are all lucky people so stuck up ? , C'mon , don't take it seriously !

Did you like it ? , Oh , yes , it was very interesting . , What were the schools like ? , Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . , But you taught children , yes ? , Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . , They actually study after school ? , That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . , Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? , Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . , Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . , So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . , But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . , As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . , Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? , That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . , Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? , I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . "

( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) , Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? , Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? , I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . , No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . , Unbelievable ! I could never do that . , Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . , Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? , Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? , Yes , let's do it . , Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . , Of course not . We don't do that . "

There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . , You were lucky then . , Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . , What did you do after that ? , We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! , So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . , Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . "

I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . , Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . , Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? , Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . , Thank you so much . You are so sweet . , Not at all . We are friends . "

Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . , I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? , Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? , No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . , I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . , Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . "

The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . , Tell me more . , The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . , Sounds great ! , I ’ m pretty happy living there . , I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . , I ’ Ve been to all of them . , I ’ m jealous .

We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . , Like what ? , Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . , It was only the cheek . , That is ok , then ?

"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! , What ? What did you buy ? , It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! , What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? , There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . , And ? , So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . , And it's a brick ? , Yes . , I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? , I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . , So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . , Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . , But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? , He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . , Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! , C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . , That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . , You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "

Why do you always take so long , It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . , Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . , Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . , True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? , Not funny . "

Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . , Where did you go ?

I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . , That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . , Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . , Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . , Yes , that's right .

I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . , It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? , There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . , Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . , I agree .

Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . , Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . , You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . , But you know if he brought it or not , right ? , Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever .

"I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . , A magic love potion ? , Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . , It can't be true . , Take my word for it . , So what am I going to do ? , Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' , That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? , Don't be so shy , Lucy . "
"All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . , What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? , Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! , Impossible .

There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . , Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . "
"What do you think of the new mayor ? , No comment . "

Could you return my camera ? , We will keep and return it later . , Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? , You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . "
"Mary , I've some bad news for you . , I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? , Yes .

You know I do need the scholarship . , I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . , Thank you . I will . "
"How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? , Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . , I never eat breakfast though . , That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . , I never thought about it that way . , I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . , Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . , Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . , I know doctor , thank you so much . "
"Are you a newcomer ? , Yeah , this is my first visit here . , You speak good English , though . , Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . , But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? , On and off , for quite a few years . "

"
"Did you have a good holiday ? , Yes and no . "
"How are you doing ? , I'm doing great . , What movies have you seen lately ? , I saw Forrest Gump the other day . , What type of movie is that ? , The movie type is drama . , I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . , I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . , What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? , I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . , Out of those what is your favorite ? , My favorite is to play computer games . , What is your favorite computer game ? , My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . , If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? , Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . , That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? , I am going to go to the bookstore . , I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . , That sounds like fun . , Great . I'll see you on Saturday . , Ok . See you later . "
"Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . , I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . , Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . , I will . See you later . "
"Shall we sing with a karaoke ? , Great idea ! I do it every so often . , For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . , Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? , I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . , I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . , Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? , So tricky ! "
"Hello , what can I do for you ? , I am looking for a host home . , How long will you stay with the host family ? , Well , at least half a year . Do I have to do my own grocery shopping ? , Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you . , That is fine . "
"I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . , Why do you say so ? , Because he is often in trouble . , She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . , Oh , I see . "
"Did you find what you were looking for ? , I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . , Okay , let's both look for it now . , Okay . "
"I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? , Me ? I prefer France . , I went to France last summer . , Oh , really ? I went to China last winter ! "

I want to take you to dinner . , Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? "
"Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? , Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? , I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . , That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? , I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . , If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? , I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . , You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . , The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . , The Taj it is then . , Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? , They'll still charge us a corkage fee . , That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . , Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . , Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . , No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . , I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! "
"Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . , I know that . , You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . , Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... , & you ? , Look , I am playing the piano for you . , Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . , Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . , OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . , Ha ! She is too little . , Cute , like you . , I want to tell you that I like you , Me too . Send you a kiss ... , Thx . "

"Did you hear what she said to me ? , I heard it . , What do you think I should do about it ? , Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . "
"How many persons are there in your family ? , There are three , my parents and I . , Do you live together ? , No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . , Do you often go back to see your parents . , Yes , almost once a week . "
"John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . , I don't mind at all . , All right.Are you married ? , To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . , Then , when do you plan to get married ? , I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air . "
"Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? , To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . , And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? , Yes , here it is . , Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? , I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . , Could I see that , please ? , Yes , here it is . , Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . , Oh , but mine is a three-year program . , Yes , it is a three-year , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure . , Okay , thank you . "

With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . , I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? , I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . , If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! , If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . , That sounds like fun . , Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! , English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . "

"You look pale recently . , Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . , Take good care of yourself . , Thank you . I will . "
"Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . , Oh , I see.Thank you . "
"I really should be on my way . , Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . , No , thanks all the same . , Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . , Thank you very much . I really had a good time . , Well , thank you for coming . , So see you . , Bye . "
"Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! , Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! , Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! , Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! , Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . , He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! , Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . , Oh yes .

Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . , Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! , That would be great ! Give me a call ! , See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . "
"I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . , I could help you with that . , Are you sure you have the time ? , I promise you that I have the time to do this .

I didn't think you would mind so much . , Never do that again . , I promise . "
"Is anything the matter , sir ? , Yes , it's my steak . , What's wrong with it , sir ? , It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . , I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked .

"Do you have much experience with kids ? , Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . , To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . , I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . , What about your mother ? Did she help you ? , Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . , I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . , Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . , Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . , No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . "

You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , I can point you towards the right direction . , I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes . , That would be in our children's section . That book shelf there on the right . , Ok , I would like to check out these books . , Do you have a library card ? , No . How do I get one ? , I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state . , Here you go . , So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . , Ok , thanks ! "

"I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . , Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . , So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . , I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon . , We really have some movable weather sometime . I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . , If it was sunning all year round there would be drought . You probably would not like it either . , I guess you are right . Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . , The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . Our weather is so changeable . "
"You're late . , I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . , My phone ? , Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . , Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . , So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . , But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . , About what ? , You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? , Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . , Do you have a cell phone ? , No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . , Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . , Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? , Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . , Alright , let's go . , Yes , let's go .

"Are you having a good time ? , Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . , Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you . , That would be great . "
"This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . , Yes . I like it very much . , Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . , It's excellent . , Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . , It's delicious . , What sort of western food do you like best ? , I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? , I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . , Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . , It's still early . "
"I am not sure how to add a class . , Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? , I'll bring one next time . , When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? , I think I know where it is . , Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? , Thank you for your directions .

"You married Joe , didn't you ? , Joe ? I don't know what you mean . , I remember you are in love . , Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . , It's Greek to me . "
"Which season do you like best ? , I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? , I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . , How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? , Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . "
"Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . , Really ? When did that happen ? , A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink .

"Hi , Natasha , how's life ? , Great . My family came to visit me . , Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? , My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . , I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . , I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? , Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . , Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? , The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . , Do you get along well with each other ? , Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . , You are very lucky to have such a nice family . , Thank you . "

Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? , I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? , Yes , if that's all right for you . , I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? , Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . , That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . "
"Jane , pleases come with us . , I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . , Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? , Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . , But ... OK . "
"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? , Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . , Is she American ? , Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! , So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? , I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . , Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? , Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . , That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? , You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . , Good luck ! , Thanks ! "
"Do you think you'll get the project ? , It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . , I see.After all , he's boss's son . , But anyway , I'll have a try . "

But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . , But you should make up your mind first . , You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . , Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . , Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . "
"Oh ! , What fools we were ! , To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . , And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . , What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . , I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . , I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? , And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . "
"I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . , David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . , What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? , It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . , Why not ? , I just think the humor was too gross .

This is what is called "" dim sum , "" right ? , Yes , all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . , So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? , Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . , And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . , No way ! , What do you mean ? , We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . , Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? , No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown . , Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? , No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . , I wonder if you can cook things this good . , I'm a great cook actually .

But we've just been too busy to look for a house . , We need to find a good realtor . , Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . , What do you mean ? , Realtors always get a commission .

They can help us . , So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? , It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . , And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? , Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . , Why ? , That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . , Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . , It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . , I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . , All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . "

Wow ! , OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly .

What fillings do you recommend ? , Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like .

Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so .

There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be , that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . , I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . , ok .

We need to use the separate units , I guess . , It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . , So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . , Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . , You mean installation isn't included ?

At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . , I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . , Well . , You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . , Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free .
