"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?"
"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates ."
"What position do you play ?"
"I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense ."
"Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself ."
"Oh , yeah ? Which team ?"
"The Rockets ."
"Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later ."
"All right , see you later . "
"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?"
"I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !"
"What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?"
"It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?"
"January 5th ."
"Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !"
"That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense ."
"No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize ."
"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?"
"A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! "
"How are Zina's new programmers working out ?"
"I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius ."
"So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ?"
"It'll be close , but we'll make it ."
"Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore ."
"And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . "
"Anyone home ? Jen !"
"I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in !"
"Wow ! You're really working up a storm !"
"I know . I've even worked up a sweat ."
"You look like a cooking show host--only messier . "
"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?"
"It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume ."
"I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that ."
"That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . "
"Ah , ah , ah ... , All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast ."
"Jog ?"
"Then , you are to walk to work ."
"Walk ?"
"Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time ."
"Oh no ."
"Use the stairs , never the elevator ."
"Oh , dear ."
"And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball ."
"Oh no ."
"OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class ."
"Dance class ! I don't know how ."
"You will ."
"Oh ... "
"Dad , why are you taping the windows ?"
"Honey , a typhoon is coming ."
"Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow ."
"Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food ."
"OK . Dad ! I'm coming . "
"Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?"
"Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run ."
"What ’ s the score ?"
"Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base ."
"So Baltimore is winning ?"
"Right ."
"This is a really great place to watch a baseball game ."
"Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place ."
"The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia ."
"It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game ."
"Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . "
"How do you like the pizza here ?"
"Perfect . It really hits the spot . "
"I was scared stiff of giving my first performance ."
"Were you ? your performance was excellent ."
"Thank you for your kindly words . "
"Every country should face the history ."
"Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history ."
"Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first ."
"But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history ."
"I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . "
"Do you like traveling , Kathy ?"
"I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... , Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving ."
"Exactly . "
"Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one ."
"I do wish I could afford one ."
"You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases ."
"Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? "
"What do you like to do in your spare time ?"
"I like playing chess ."
"Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?"
"I'm afraid not ."
"Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?"
"Oh , yes . I like playing basketball ."
"Can you tell me why you like it ?"
"Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . "
"Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ?"
"Well , I have the day off from work ."
"That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy ."
"Sounds nice ."
"Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies ."
"Can I stop by ?"
"Sure . Any time . "
"You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ?"
"Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ?"
"I don ’ t think you ’ re right there ."
"I believe industry is making us wealthier ."
"I don ’ t believe that ."
"And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier ."
"I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ?"
"I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago ."
"That ’ s your opinion not mine . "
"Could you tell me the right time , please ?"
"Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days ."
"You have to go and fix it ."
"Yes . I will . "
"does your family have a record of your ancestors ?"
"sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it ."
"do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it ."
"I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far ."
"that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ?"
"I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side ."
"are you very close to your first-cousins ?"
"the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones ."
"I see . who ’ s the head of your household ?"
"it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family ."
"that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?"
"at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother ."
"that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . "
"I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ?"
"Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team ."
"Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ?"
"Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration ."
"Could you move smoothly ?"
"Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind ."
"What happened afterwards ?"
"I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was ."
"Poor girl ! "
"Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ?"
"About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything ."
"You know , about David and his new boss ."
"Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you ."
"Well , I heard David has been fired ."
"Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . "
"What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ?"
"Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot ."
"You are going to take courses ?"
"Yes . I am going to take some university courses there ."
"Sounds hard ."
"Yes , but I think it's probably for the best ."
"Won ’ t you get lonely ?"
"Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . "
"On , darn . The grocery store is closed ."
"Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth ."
"Alright . We are out of everything ."
"I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day ."
"I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home ."
"Yeah , and the prices there are very high ."
"I know . Three dollars for milk . "
"I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo ."
"Really ? Are you sure ?"
"Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back ."
"Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot !"
"Really ?"
"Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink ."
"Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something ."
"I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic ."
"Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! "
"Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ?"
"It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now ."
"Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?"
"News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on ."
"Is there anything interesting ?"
"Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education ."
"I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?"
"Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs ."
"That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?"
"Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals ."
"I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?"
"Yes , 50 Yuan per month . "
"Oh , no !"
"How dreadful !"
"Look at the view from the window ."
"Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected ."
"It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?"
"I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed ."
"It can ’ t be helped . "
"What do you do in your free time , Nancy ?"
"Well , I like playing the violin ."
"Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ?"
"About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school ."
"That's really interesting ."
"Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?"
"Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though ."
"Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . "
"What upsets you ?"
"My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date ."
"It is not your mother finding one for you ?"
"I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl ."
"Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type ."
"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea ."
"No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes ."
"I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time ."
"I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight ."
"Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that ."
"Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher ."
"I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . "
"I'll never ever work together with him !"
"What happened ? Quarrel again ?"
"Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please !"
"Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . "
"What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good ."
"Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !"
"I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff ."
"Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe ."
"A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me ."
"It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff ."
"Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says ."
"Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?"
"There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !"
"Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?"
"Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? "
"Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?"
"I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning , Does that mean studying all the time ?"
"I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors ."
"Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer ."
"You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts , Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active ."
"Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things ."
"You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French ."
"Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France ."
"Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . "
"It smells like an ashtray in here !"
"Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?"
"What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking ."
"No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !"
"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before ."
"I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?"
"Fine ! I want a divorce ! "
"Why are you shivering ?"
"It's freezing . "
"Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard ."
"I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . "
"Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ?"
"Sure , I have . Will you join ?"
"I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere ."
"You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking ."
"I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there ."
"No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that ."
"Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . "
"If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow ."
"I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . "
"Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ?"
"Yes , I did . But I feel tired today ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country ."
"And I bet you studied , too ."
"Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ?"
"Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV ."
"That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ?"
"Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! "
"There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend ."
"What's the route ?"
"From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank ."
"If only I could join it ! "
"What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?"
"I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?"
"About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world ."
"I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly ."
"Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday ."
"Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment ."
"How ’ s your son these days ?"
"Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays ."
"He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?"
"I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties ."
"or even in your early thirties if you have a good career ."
"Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet ."
"Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?"
"Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed ."
"Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom ."
"It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . "
"Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make ."
"Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?"
"Did you have the room checked before we move in ?"
"Which room are you in ?"
"1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower ."
"I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . "
"You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?"
"Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired ."
"I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job ."
"I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !"
"You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices ."
"That's right , I have to work hard . "
"Excuse me , is this seat taken ?"
"No , please feel free ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"Do you work in Shanghai ?"
"Yes I do . How about you ?"
"No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here ."
"You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ?"
"Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure !"
"Uh huh ... "
"Look at this headline , Soo Mi ."
"Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced !"
"Is it the same in Korea ?"
"I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together ."
"Do people get married young ?"
"Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 ."
"Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ?"
"No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . "
"Excuse me.Where do I register ?"
"Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion ."
"Is that the large , white building ?"
"Yeah , that's it ."
"Thanks . "
"How was your education going on in Australia ?"
"I'm going to graduate this summer ."
"Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ?"
"I'm planning to return to China after graduation ."
"Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad ."
"Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment ."
"Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . "
"Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ?"
"Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite ."
"I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ?"
"I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating ."
"You won't play online games full of violence , will you ?"
"Once in a while ."
"It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful ."
"I hope I can practice self-control again . "
"What ’ s the plot of your new movie ?"
"It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th , Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director ."
"I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no , Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ?"
"Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think ."
"Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?"
"I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future ."
"Thank you very much for doing this interview ."
"My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ?"
"Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . "
"Who's that old lady trimming the trees ?"
"She's my grandma ."
"She's looks very healthy.How old is she ?"
"92 . "
"Mom . My legs are killing me ."
"Hold on . We will be successful right away . "
"Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !"
"I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !"
"Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... , What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! "
"Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?"
"It was a nightmare ."
"What ’ s up ?"
"Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year ."
"Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?"
"Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout ."
"This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?"
"I am still waiting for their call ."
"Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . "
"Happy anniversary , sweetheart !"
"Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers !"
"I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering ."
"Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing ."
"That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song ."
"I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?"
"Always . "
"How about seconds , Victor ?"
"No.thanks . I'm full . "
"Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?"
"I'd love to ."
"Let's say about 6:00 ?"
"That's OK with me . "
"Cigarette ?"
"Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ?"
"Sorry , here ."
"Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty ."
"I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do ."
"Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . "
"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ?"
"I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program ."
"Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that ."
"Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all ."
"All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram ."
"Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want ."
"That's exactly what I want , thank you . "
"What would you reckon the taxing increases ?"
"Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose ."
"But what do most people think about it ?"
"Ah , it ’ s hard to say . "
"Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not ."
"Why doesn't he ask her ?"
"He is too scared to ask her ."
"He's a chicken guy . "
"I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit ."
"Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy ."
"If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that ."
"She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? "
"Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere ."
"Haven't you heard that he is in prison ?"
"What ? Beg your pardon ."
"John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing ."
"I just cann't believe my ears ! "
"What do you make of the case ?"
"If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty ."
"What do you mean by saying so ?"
"I mean it ’ s not his fault ."
"Oh , yeah ?"
"Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? "
"I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ?"
"He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked ."
"Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte ."
"When did you start worrying about your weight ?"
"I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ?"
"No , Jess , chill out ! "
"Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes ."
"We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon ."
"Two tickets , please . How much are they ?"
"Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist ."
"I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper ."
"Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama ."
"Are these seats okay ?"
"They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . "
"Do you often buy magazines ?"
"I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments ."
"Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?"
"Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes ."
"Do you have an online edition of that magazine ?"
"Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription ."
"Do you have a subscription ?"
"Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ?"
"I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . "
"Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue ."
"It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way ."
"Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you ."
"I'm sorry . What's your name again ?"
"Barbara . But please , just call me Barb ."
"So Barb ... what do you do ?"
"I'm studying medicine ."
"Really ? Where ?"
"At Harvard . What about you ?"
"I'm an engineer at IBM ."
"Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting ."
"Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready ."
"Good . I'm starving . "
"hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?"
"part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?"
"oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?"
"sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender ."
"cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !"
"yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset ."
"that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?"
"of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world ."
"you mean you got working experience , right ?"
"not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life ."
"it must be very demanding ."
"sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out ."
"really ? It sounds interesting ."
"maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around ."
"great . I ’ m looking forward to it . "
"Have you got any hobbies ?"
"Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards ."
"Which is easier to learn ?"
"Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . "
"Jim , how was your weekend ?"
"I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there ."
"That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ?"
"Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go ."
"I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation ."
"It sure is ."
"I can ’ t wait to go there myself . "
"What is the correct time , please ?"
"It's exactly twelve minutes past seven ."
"When will the lecture begin ?"
"It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . "
"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !"
"My first grandchild ."
"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does ."
"Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though ."
"Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does ."
"Well , children usually resemble their parents ."
"It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is ."
"You often like comparing children with their parents ."
"You ’ re right . "
"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?"
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?"
"I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays ."
"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory ."
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion ."
"But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?"
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world ."
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?"
"That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion ."
"Really ?"
"Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England ."
"Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?"
"Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans ."
"How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?"
"That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries ."
"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?"
"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College ."
"Why did they want to found a college ?"
"Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well ."
"Oh , I see ."
"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name ."
"When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?"
"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman ."
"It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion ."
"Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard ."
"Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history ."
"Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S ."
"I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard ."
"Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related ."
"That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you ."
"You can ask me any question at any time . "
"I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ?"
"Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us ."
"I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock ."
"But I have an appointment with Ann ."
"Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . "
"What do you do in summer ?"
"I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ?"
"I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book ."
"What do you do in winter ?"
"Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter ."
"I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter ."
"Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !"
"Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?"
"Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! "
"I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover ."
"I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying ."
"I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget ."
"But I think time can change everything . "
"What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good ."
"Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !"
"I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff ."
"Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe ."
"A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me ."
"It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff ."
"Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says ."
"Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?"
"There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !"
"Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?"
"Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? "
"Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ?"
"I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts ."
"Wow , you sound very professional ."
"I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . "
"Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six ."
"In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime ."
"Ok , Goodbye ."
"See you later . "
"Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !"
"Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester ."
"That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , , That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o , Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture ."
"I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes ."
"Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice ."
"I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese ."
"Well , there is that , yes . "
"Good morning , Miss Li ."
"Morning , Mike ."
"I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday ."
"I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ?"
"I feel much better now ."
"Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?"
"I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks ."
"I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ?"
"I will . "
"Do you like flowers ?"
"Of course , I like ."
"What's your favorite flower ?"
"Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival ."
"Spring is a lively season ."
"Yes . How about you ?"
"I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter ."
"You have a perfect taste !"
"It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms ."
"But it used to be ignored by many people ."
"The bright people will remember it forever ."
"Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . "
"What is the weather like today ?"
"It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind ."
"And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ?"
"I missed today's weather for cast in the radio , It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery ."
"The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport , That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . "
"What kind of music do you like listening to ?"
"I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work ."
"I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music ."
"Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better ."
"Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress ."
"Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework ."
"I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power ."
"You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them ."
"That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier ."
"That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . "
"Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon ."
"Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby ."
"Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday ."
"Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own ."
"In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese ."
"Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?"
"It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now ."
"Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? "
"Well , I am a regular member of this club ."
"Do you have to pay to join ?"
"Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars ."
"Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ?"
"Very few , unfortunately ."
"How was your game today ?"
"Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies !"
"Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?"
"Ten . How did your game go ?"
"My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps ."
"Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . "
"I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ?"
"Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ?"
"It's at 8: 00 ."
"That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ?"
"Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late ."
"Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 ."
"That sounds fine . "
"Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?"
"No , it's the Japanese team ."
"Japanese teams always play a dark horse ."
"Well , their team work is well worth learning . "
"This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?"
"A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive ."
"Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast ."
"Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly ."
"Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ?"
"Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks ."
"Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car ."
"Cut out , would you ? "
"Bob is getting on in years ."
"Yeah , I'm very worried about his health ."
"He looks tired all the time ."
"He's working too hard . "
"Which church do you attend ?"
"I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ."
"What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ?"
"Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church ."
"Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?"
"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all ."
"Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ?"
"Yes ."
"Why do you really go to church ?"
"We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . "
"Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?"
"Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet ."
"People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder ."
"You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night ."
"There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited ."
"Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?"
"Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states ."
"Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment ."
"I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that ."
"I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair !"
"Don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . "
"Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ?"
"Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ?"
"Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ?"
"Fine , see you then . "
"Are there many idioms in English ?"
"There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions ."
"Can you give us an example ?"
"I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information ."
"What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?"
"That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages ."
"This is interesting , Ms.Parker . "
"Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?"
"Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely ."
"I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . "
"Have you heard of the Love Bug ?"
"Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ?"
"Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year ."
"This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?"
"Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it ."
"So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick . "
"Where are you going ?"
"I ’ m going to the hospital ."
"What ’ s the matter ?"
"Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident ."
"That ’ s too bad . How are things now ?"
"His life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . "
"Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?"
"Sorry , I can't . I am busy ."
"What are you doing ?"
"I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month ."
"What kind of volunteer work ?"
"I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities ."
"Oh , yeah ?"
"Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles . "
"Are the children all grown up now , Rose ?"
"Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer ."
"Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading ."
"She ’ s a librarian at the public library ."
"Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl ."
"Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer ."
"Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ?"
"Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him ."
"Really ? Where does he live now ?"
"Colorado ."
"And does Rocky drive a truck , too ?"
"Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot ."
"Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ?"
"Yes . Mostly to England and France . "
"Merry Christmas , Linda !"
"Merry Christmas , Lee !"
"Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it ."
"Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . "
"Who's singing in your home , Jim ?"
"It's Ellie and her friends ."
"Who's Ellie ?"
"She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing "" Happy Birthday "" ."
"Oh , I see.how old is she ?"
"She's ten ."
"I suppose they're playing games ."
"Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ?"
"Today ."
"Today ?"
"Yes ."
"Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?"
"Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?"
"Very much.What time ?"
"About 6:00 ."
"I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday . "
"I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people ."
"And what did the program say ?"
"It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier ."
"I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea ."
"And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress ."
"And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . "
"Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders ."
"Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !"
"We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !"
"not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black ."
"The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes ."
"I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field ."
"Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good ."
"Let's hope it is ! "
"What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand ."
"It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm ."
"Such a thing exists ?"
"Fortunately , yes . You're blushing !"
"Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast ."
"You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... "
"Did you get any rewards or honors in college ?"
"Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end ."
"Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ?"
"Yes , I joined the CPC when I was a freshman "
"Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much ."
"Let ’ s go for a joy ride . "
"The weekend's finally here !"
"And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that ."
"Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow ."
"Sounds good . What do we need to bring ?"
"We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad ."
"I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . "
"Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning ."
"What ’ s up ?"
"I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow ."
"America ? Did you get admit to MIT ?"
"Yes ."
"Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you ."
"Thank you ."
"Really going to miss you ."
"Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call ."
"Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey ."
"Thank you ."
"Look after yourself . Bye ."
"Bye . "
"Did you see Ally Mabel last night ?"
"Yes , I did . Did you ?"
"Yes , wasn't it funny ?"
"Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ?"
"Ha , yes , brilliant ! "
"Did you see May today ?"
"Yes , but why does she have such a long face ?"
"I don't have the foggiest idea ."
"I thought she'd be happy ."
"Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently ."
"I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . "
"I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution ."
"Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry ."
"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced ."
"The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it ."
"I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? "
"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !"
"My first grandchild ."
"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does ."
"Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though ."
"Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does ."
"Well , children usually resemble their parents ."
"It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is ."
"You often like comparing children with their parents ."
"You ’ re right . "
"There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?"
"I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late ."
"We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection ."
"Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life ."
"In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food ."
"It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people ."
"Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment ."
"I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . "
"Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ?"
"I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef ."
"You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking !"
"Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it ."
"When did you change your mind ?"
"After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family ."
"I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ?"
"Yeah . I went to California to study ."
"Really ? How long did you stay there ?"
"I was there between 88 and 90 ."
"And what did you do after that ?"
"Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . "
"Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend ."
"A house warming party ?"
"Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn ."
"Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy ."
"Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive ."
"I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city ."
"That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby ."
"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I am trying to find this book ."
"What ’ s the problem ?"
"It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it ."
"Have you checked the computer ?"
"I have already ."
"What did it say ?"
"It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there ."
"I can always borrow the book from another library ."
"You can do that ?"
"I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in ."
"That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . "
"I'm really sick of waiting for a bus ."
"Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do ."
"But a taxi costs too much ."
"That's true . "
"What are you two doing in here ?"
"We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you ."
"I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was ."
"Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside ."
"All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ?"
"I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... "
"What happen , John ?"
"Nothing ."
"Why do you look unhappy ?"
"I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off ."
"Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . "
"This man is your fiance , Dolly ?"
"Yeah , how do you like him ?"
"He's handsome ."
"Can you give me a touch of his character ?"
"He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . "
"Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ?"
"No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... , It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... , They're going to give us back the seats ?"
"No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... , Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ?"
"You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas ."
"Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! "
"Is sailing fun ?"
"You bet ! "
"John dates her seven times a week ."
"Really ? That's a straws in the wind ."
"I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her ."
"Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl ."
"Right . "
"Good morning , Loans ."
"Good morning , Mr . Smith ."
"I would like to compliment you on your diligence ."
"Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job ."
"Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans ."
"It's nice of you to say so . "
"Which countries have you been to ?"
"I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada ."
"I thought you had been to Australia too ."
"No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?"
"I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains ."
"Isn ’ t it really cold there ?"
"Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter ."
"I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . "
"Alison , would you like to have some more ?"
"No thanks . I have had enough ."
"Actually you haven't have much ."
"To tell you the truth , I am on the diet ."
"That sounds ridiculous . Why ?"
"Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
"Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ?"
"No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ?"
"Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics ."
"I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market ."
"Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . "
"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them ."
"I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it ."
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?"
"I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films ."
"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party ."
"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like ."
"I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored ."
"I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves ."
"Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 "
"Hi , it is a pleasant surprise !"
"Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?"
"Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?"
"Just as usual , you know . "
"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?"
"Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything ."
"The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy ."
"Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !"
"I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?"
"You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?"
"Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are ."
"Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down ."
"Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? "
"Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid !"
"Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?"
"Yes , it is . How do you know that ?"
"Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting ."
"Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?"
"I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings ."
"That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture ."
"I love this art exhibition !"
"So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ?"
"OK . "
"Lousy weather , isn't it ?"
"It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder ."
"Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves ."
"And the streets are covered with snow ."
"Do you know what the temperature is today ?"
"I missed today's weather forecast over the TV ."
"It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery ."
"The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports ."
"That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . "
"Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?"
"I went to Yale University ."
"Did you ? And what did you study ?"
"I have a B . A . in Economics ."
"Would you mind telling me how old you are ?"
"I'm twenty-seven ."
"And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?"
"Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years ."
"And what was your salary at the bank ?"
"I got $ 500 a week . "
"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?"
"I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired ."
"Late night ?"
"Yeah , I got home around two . "
"I ’ m forming a music band ."
"Do you already know how to play an instrument ?"
"Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band ."
"Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?"
"We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?"
"Yes , I ’ m a singer ."
"Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house ."
"Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? "
"I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide ."
"Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 ."
"I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference ."
"Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?"
"I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . "
"What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ?"
"Sure.Where would you suggest ?"
"How about going to the suburbs ?"
"Sounds good . "
"Hi , Bill ."
"Hi , Jim ."
"Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks ."
"He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy ."
"Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ?"
"Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . "
"Do you mind if I ask you a question ?"
"No , not at all . Go ahead ."
"What do you do in order to improve your English ?"
"I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get ."
"It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?"
"Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension ."
"It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?"
"It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . "
"Good morning , Sue ."
"Good morning , Tom.How are you ?"
"I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ?"
"Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ?"
"I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ?"
"I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run ."
"See you later , alligator ."
"After a while , crocodile . "
"Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine ."
"It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important ."
"What methods do you use to conserve water ?"
"Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water ."
"I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution ."
"Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry ."
"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced ."
"The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it ."
"I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . "
"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?"
"Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section ."
"Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this , Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?"
"It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done ."
"It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !"
"It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b , Is that better ?"
"Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?"
"Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make ."
"That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any "
"Can you tell me the time ?"
"It's 5:30 by my watch ."
"Is your watch right ?"
"Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . "
"Hi , Mary , long time no see ."
"I heard through the grapevine that your getting married ."
"Yes , next March ."
"Congratulations , I hope everything works out . "
"Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?"
"I wouldn't say so ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . "
"is everything alright ?"
"yes , everything is fine ."
"what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !"
"didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?"
"I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ?"
"we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem ."
"then what ? Your plane was three hours late !"
"we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight ."
"turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?"
"yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early ."
"so where did you land ?"
"we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again ."
"that sounds like a nightmare !"
"it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive ."
"have you had anything to eat ?"
"I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?"
"I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! "
"You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor ."
"Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry ."
"Luckily that was nothing serious ."
"Thank God ! "
"What's going on here ?"
"We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year !"
"Master Li ? Who's that ?"
"He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line !"
"I will ! I could use some good luck ! "
"Hey Mike . What are you doing ?"
"Nothing much . What are you up to ?"
"I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately ."
"He took the civil service exam and failed ."
"That sucks . He must feel depressed ."
"Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days ."
"Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him ."
"That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else ."
"Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done ."
"Sounds good . "
"Hello , Steven . Congratulations !"
"Thank you ."
"How's your married life ?"
"We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple ."
"That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right ."
"The situation differs in person . "
"are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !"
"I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week ."
"Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... , No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time ."
"What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation ."
"They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars ."
"That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?"
"I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for ."
"it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! "
"The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural !"
"I felt as if I had been in a different world ."
"And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . "
"I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening ."
"Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ?"
"Nonsmoking , please ."
"All right . May I have your name ?"
"My surname is Gao ."
"How do you spell it , sir ? "
"why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up !"
"oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company ."
"it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer ."
"but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again ."
"why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it ."
"she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys ."
"that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ?"
"I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time ."
"I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind ."
"I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ?"
"just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job ."
"do you think it will work ?"
"sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try ."
"ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris ."
"sure . Good luck , Maria ! "
"Where did you go yesterday ?"
"I went to play tennis in the public park ."
"How often do you play tennis ?"
"Twice a week . How about you ?"
"I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball ."
"What is very difficult to gather team player together ."
"I usually play with my school-mates ."
"Do you like watching football matches ?"
"Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . "
"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office ."
"Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?"
"What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one ."
"Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . "
"I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people ."
"And what did the program say ?"
"It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier ."
"I think that many physicians now agree with that idea ."
"And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress ."
"And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . "
"Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits ."
"I was playing a joke on you ."
"That ’ s too much ."
"Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . "
"Where are you going this weekend ?"
"I ’ m going to Hainan ."
"Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ?"
"Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October ."
"I see . What ’ s it like there ?"
"Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier !"
"Well , have a great time ! "
"My girlfriend dumped me ."
"Well , that's life . "
"I think he deserved his gold ."
"Did you see his last dive ?"
"Yes , it's perfect !"
"He's diving for the gold . "
"You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I have been here for three years ."
"Do you like this campus ?"
"Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it ."
"How come ?"
"It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected ."
"Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped ."
"I ’ ll just have to put up with it . "
"How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe !"
"Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck ."
"I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . "
"Hi Mark ."
"Hi ."
"What are you planning to do today ?"
"I'm not sure yet ."
"Would you like to have lunch with me ?"
"Yes . When ?"
"Is 11:30 AM OK ?"
"Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ?"
"I said , 11:30 AM ."
"Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ?"
"OK , how about 12:30 PM ?"
"OK . Where ?"
"How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?"
"Oh , Where is that ?"
"It's on 7th Street ."
"OK , I'll meet you there . "
"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company ."
"Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it ."
"You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?"
"Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions ."
"Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something ."
"Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . "
"I hate to say goodbye , but it's late ."
"Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 ."
"I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go ."
"OK.See you on Today ."
"See you on Moday.Have a great weekend ."
"You too.Thanks for dropping in . "
"Are you really dating with Frank ?"
"Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking ."
"Then why not keep away from him ?"
"The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now ."
"That ’ s stupid . "
"Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall ."
"Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing ."
"That ’ s right ."
"You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . "
"Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger ."
"No problem . I can deal with it well ."
"You will ask for it ."
"All is best now , isn ’ t it ? "
"My friend Jean is very beautiful ."
"What's her figure ?"
"Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too ."
"What's the color of her eyes ?"
"Dark blue . "
"What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?"
"I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?"
"About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world ."
"I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly ."
"Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday ."
"Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment ."
"How ’ s your son these days ?"
"Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays ."
"He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?"
"I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties ."
"or even in your early thirties if you have a good career ."
"Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet ."
"Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?"
"Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed ."
"Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom ."
"It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . "
"Whose part do you think is best played ?"
"That of the old man ."
"You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best ."
"Some of the scenes moved me into tears . "
"Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker ."
"Pardon ?"
"I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon ."
"Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad ."
"It isn't Elvin ."
"Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious ."
"Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . "
"Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason ."
"Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... , But what ?"
"But he is always talking big . "
"How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ?"
"I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . "
"The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain ."
"I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures ."
"I ’ m sure they will . "
"Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?"
"I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish ."
"Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?"
"Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching ."
"Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ?"
"Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things ."
"Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?"
"Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . "
"Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ?"
"I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act ."
"He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves ."
"But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . "
"I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis ."
"What's he like ?"
"Oh , he's a very serious person ."
"You must feel very uneasy at his home . "
"Hi ! My name is Mike ."
"Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you ."
"Nice to meet you , too ."
"Where are you from ?"
"I'm from Shanghai . And you ?"
"I'm from Chicago . "
"Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you ."
"Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already ."
"It ’ s all right ."
"I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting ."
"I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ?"
"Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up ."
"I totally understand . "
"Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... , Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ?"
"Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play ."
"You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... , Alright ... I get your point . "
"I don't think we've met ."
"No , I don't think we have ."
"My name is Dick Brown ."
"How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood ."
"Mr . Smith often talked about you ."
"Really ? I am glad to meet you ."
"I'm honored to know you . "
"My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday , What happened ?"
"She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt ."
"Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit , We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon , OK . Let's go "
"What are the good sights to see in Beijing ?"
"Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . "
"Taylor , you're sweating up a storm !"
"Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out ."
"Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun ."
"You're like the tenth person to say that ."
"We're just worried about you , Taylor ."
"Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! "
"She is so stupid ."
"Who cares ? She is pretty ."
"So what ?"
"You're just jealous . "
"Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you !"
"Thank you.You ' re partial ."
"I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day ."
"It's nice to hear that anyway . "
"What a police officer !"
"I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films ."
"It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . "
"In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ?"
"The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side ."
"Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ?"
"They usually do . "
"Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ?"
"He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while ."
"That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some ."
"Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . "
"Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?"
"Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely ."
"I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . "
"Is your city a historical place ?"
"Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village ."
"How did it grow into such a large place ?"
"Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre ."
"As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby ."
"Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city ."
"I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?"
"Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too ."
"Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . "
"What is wrong with your face ?"
"My brother did it ."
"Why ?"
"I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . "
"How's Jerry's new school ?"
"Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well ."
"He's a team player ."
"Yes , indeed . "
"It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go ."
"Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . "
"How may I help you ?"
"I want to return this video ."
"Is that all you need ?"
"I also need to check this magazine out ."
"You ’ re not allowed to do that ."
"I don ’ t understand ."
"It ’ s our policy ."
"What can I check out ?"
"Only books or videos ."
"I need this magazine ."
"You will have to read it here ."
"That ’ s weird . "
"Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today ."
"Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune ."
"Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . "
"That was heaven !"
"The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you ."
"Really ?"
"But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body ."
"Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! "
"You got a letter in the mail ."
"Give it to me ."
"What is it ?"
"It ’ s from NYU ."
"What does it say ?"
"I didn ’ t get accepted ."
"You can ’ t be serious !"
"I ’ m serious ."
"Are you all right ?"
"NYU was my first choice ."
"I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in ."
"I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . "
"What ’ s your new job like ?"
"Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office ."
"Um ."
"And a company car ."
"Very nice ."
"Yes , it is . But I ’ Ve got a lot of work too ."
"Well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ? "
"What a surprise meeting you here , Landy ."
"I ’ m here as a tourist ."
"It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . "
"Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long ."
"Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts ."
"That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated ."
"You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old ."
"No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again ."
"One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished ."
"How could he make such a silly mistake ?"
"He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then ."
"He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ?"
"Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects ."
"That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . "
"What did you do over the weekend ?"
"I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment ."
"Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?"
"It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening ."
"Like what ?"
"Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start ."
"What else can we do to protect the environment ?"
"If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy ."
"How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?"
"Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center ."
"What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?"
"I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone ."
"I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !"
"To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . "
"Who broke the glass , Peter ?"
"That cat ."
"I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam ."
"It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . "
"Where should I sit ?"
"Why don't you sit in the back with me ?"
"Okay ."
"By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is ."
"It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N ."
"R-I-N ?"
"My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin ."
"I got it . Mary Lin ."
"Lin is a common Chinese last name . "
"What do you think of this one ?"
"Eh , so so ."
"And this one ? Too flashy ?"
"Nah , not too flashy ."
"Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?"
"I guess ."
"Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you ."
"And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !"
"Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !"
"Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !"
"Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !"
"Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?"
"I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !"
"And Merry Christmas !"
"Merry Christmas ! "
"Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy ."
"How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed ."
"But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts ."
"Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . "
"Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ?"
"It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them ."
"Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff ."
"You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?"
"You can say that ."
"But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?"
"They must have mixed hackers with crackers ."
"What is crackers then ?"
"There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them ."
"So they are two totally different concepts ."
"Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end ."
"I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them ."
"You got it ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"You are welcome . "
"I don't have my homework today ."
"You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ?"
"I was really sick ."
"But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ?"
"Yes , I probably could ."
"You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ?"
"Next class meeting ."
"That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ?"
"That would work for me ."
"Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . "
"What are you reading about in that science magazine ?"
"There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning ."
"I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing ."
"According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human ."
"In the future , that could be possible ."
"In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original !"
"Really ? What else have you discovered ?"
"I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune , That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . "
"Thanks for helping me up ."
"Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger ."
"I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over !"
"That takes talent ... , I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing !"
"He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . "
"What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?"
"I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory ."
"When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?"
"Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time ."
"There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?"
"I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground ."
"There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?"
"I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell ."
"You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait ."
"If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . "
"Where did you go yesterday ?"
"I went to play tennis in the public park ."
"How often do you play tennis ?"
"Twice a week . How about you ?"
"I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball ."
"But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together ."
"I usually play with my schoolmates ."
"Do you like watching football matches ?"
"Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday ."
"Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . "
"Where is your native place ?"
"My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city ."
"So are you a local ?"
"Yes , I am a local resident . "
"What ’ re you doing now ?"
"I ’ m watching TV ."
"You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed ."
"I will ."
"And don ’ t ever forget it . "
"What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?"
"I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me ."
"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows ."
"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done ."
"You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . "
"Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ?"
"Yes ."
"Did you use to work at NYU ?"
"Yes , I did ."
"Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student ."
"Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?"
"Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university ."
"I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ?"
"Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now ."
"A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?"
"Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers ."
"Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . "
"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest ."
"Really ? Congratulations !"
"Thank you , Paul ."
"By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday ."
"Good , happy birthday to you !"
"Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?"
"Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me ."
"My pleasure . "
"I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works ."
"Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective ."
"Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club ."
"You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat ."
"I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . "
"I visited the Polar Aquarium today ."
"Is it like a zoo of polar animals ?"
"Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them ."
"It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds ."
"Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days ."
"Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . "
"I can ’ t wait to retire ."
"And then what ?"
"And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !"
"That sounds boring to me ."
"What do you plan on doing after you retire ?"
"Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher ."
"I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . "
"What ’ s the area of your country ?"
"It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers ."
"That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ?"
"There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north ."
"What ’ s the average income ?"
"That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars ."
"So your country is fairly rich ."
"I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years ."
"Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . "
"Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ?"
"I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself ."
"It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines ."
"I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others ."
"Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food ."
"I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . "
"Hi ."
"Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... , Yeah ?"
"You were playing it very late last night ."
"Yeah ?"
"It kept me awake ."
"Oh , I'm sorry ."
"It kept me awake a couple of hours ."
"I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud ."
"It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me ."
"It's true.It was a bit loud ."
"I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future ."
"Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once ."
"I am glad we've straightened everything out . "
"My mother likes to split hairs ."
"What do you mean by that ?"
"She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper ."
"Mothers like that . "
"Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ?"
"I'm at home painting ."
"I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ?"
"I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college ."
"That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby ."
"Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it ."
"I think I will . Thanks for the info . "
"Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty ."
"Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic ."
"Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie ."
"I am also impressed with the lines in the movie ."
"Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get ."
"That's my favorite ."
"You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable !"
"It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration ."
"Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble ."
"All in all , it will never lose its appeal ."
"Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ?"
"Sure . Now you are talking . "
"What are you reading ?"
"Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller ."
"I thought he usually wrote horror books ."
"He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read ."
"We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?"
"Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks ."
"Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter ."
"I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography ."
"This is sure to be a worthwhile read . "
"Do you know what the BBS is ?"
"Sure ."
"Tell me then ."
"BBS means Bulletin Board Service ."
"Oh , I see , but what's it used for ?"
"A lot of things !"
"Tell me in details ."
"Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums ."
"Oh , that's great . I want to try later ."
"Why not ? "
"When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ?"
"Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns ."
"But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns ."
"If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns ."
"I will think about it . "
"I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?"
"He appeals to the fans thanks to two things , You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks ."
"Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time ."
"In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls ."
"Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout ."
"And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . "
"Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier ."
"Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three ."
"Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before ."
"When will we get one of those ?"
"You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . "
"I really dislike reading academic books ."
"That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . "
"Where to , miss ?"
"Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner ."
"Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ?"
"From China ."
"Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so ."
"It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products ."
"Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?"
"Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ?"
"Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !"
"Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?"
"I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage ."
"Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?"
"Uh ... yeah .. of course !"
"Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! "
"Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now ."
"That ’ s all right . I understand ."
"I ’ m so sorry ."
"That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . "
"Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ?"
"We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do ."
"Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses ."
"Like what ?"
"Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way ."
"That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?"
"Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it ."
"Is the house pretty run-down ."
"Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her ."
"Was it a very old house ?"
"It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time ."
"Is it in a good location ?"
"The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . "
"Do Mona and Jim need a new house ?"
"No , they have a big new fancy house ."
"Does Jim make a lot of money ?"
"Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer ."
"Does Jim need to make more money ?"
"Afraid so . The more the better ."
"What do they need all that money for ?"
"Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money ."
"Do they have any children ?"
"No . They want children but no luck yet ."
"What does Jim like to do ?"
"Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money ."
"What does Mona like to do ?"
"Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry ."
"Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife ."
"I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government ."
"Politics can be an expensive hobby ."
"She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps ."
"Politics is a hard game to play ."
"She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . "
"Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?"
"That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher ."
"What was she like ?"
"She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her ."
"What kind of things did you learn ?"
"She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do ."
"Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?"
"If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it ."
"You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ?"
"She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined ."
"I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students ."
"Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets ."
"Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?"
"Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets ."
"Do you know what she is doing now ?"
"As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book ."
"Have you ever read one of the books ?"
"Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books ."
"Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?"
"ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . "
"Did you like the party ?"
"Not particularly . I was rather disappointed ."
"Why ? What had you expected ?"
"I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . "
"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?"
"To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here ."
"The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else ."
"Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?"
"Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game ."
"Who plays who ?"
"Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience ."
"It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?"
"In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever ."
"I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall ."
"Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful ."
"I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game ."
"Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game ."
"That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy ."
"Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?"
"You are always so naughty . "
"Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?"
"I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers ."
"Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . "
"Is that Mr . Green ?"
"This is him speaking ."
"I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc ."
"Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . "
"I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it ."
"Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before ."
"In my opinion , you ’ ll make it ."
"You ’ re having me on again ."
"No , I ’ m serious . "
"Peter and Mary broke up ."
"Are you serious ? "
"Do you know Sally ?"
"Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains ."
"Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock ."
"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . "
"Do you hear what happened to Sally ?"
"No , what ?"
"She had to go to the hospital ."
"Why ?"
"She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days ."
"Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy !"
"Yeah , but that's what she did ."
"I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look ."
"Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen ."
"True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . "
"Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ?"
"I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye ."
"Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man ."
"That ’ s why many people look up to him . "
"Hi . Are you new in this class ?"
"Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone ."
"My name is Steven . What's your name ?"
"My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ?"
"Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese ."
"I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese ."
"I guess English has fewer characters ."
"You are right . "
"Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her ."
"I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you ."
"She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married ."
"Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger !"
"Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ?"
"Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? "
"Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . ."
"You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible ."
"But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ?"
"It's once in blue moon ."
"What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ?"
"The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . "
"Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ?"
"No , I was out . Was it worth watching ?"
"You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero ."
"Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ?"
"Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . "
"Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it ."
"Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first ."
"What should I do then ?"
"I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour ."
"I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?"
"Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! "
"I'm terribly nervous ."
"Calm down ! "
"What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ?"
"Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids ."
"The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... , And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery !"
"You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? "
"Tony looks very handsome in the suit ."
"He prefers suits to jackets ."
"Judge from his look , he's a very serious person ."
"As a matter of fact , he is . "
"Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?"
"Yeah how ’ d you know ?"
"You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?"
"Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin ."
"It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?"
"Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio ."
"In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle ."
"Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !"
"It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... "
"I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working ."
"He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep ."
"If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . "
"Tony looks very handsome in the suit ."
"He prefers suits to jackets ."
"Judge from his look , he's a very serious person ."
"As a matter of fact , he is . "
"You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith ."
"Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil ."
"I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that ."
"Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . "
"Wow ! It ’ s packed ."
"The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . "
"Susan ? What brings you here today ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due ."
"Really ? So what ’ s the news ?"
"Not too good yet . Better than I was though . "
"Hello , Mary ."
"Hello , Brian ."
"Here is my friend Bob ."
"Hello , Bob . "
"Are you free tonight ?"
"Depends . "
"Wanna chill out and watch cable ?"
"Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ?"
"It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials ."
"This show is like a black Friends ."
"BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV ."
"That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . "
"So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ?"
"Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay ."
"Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there ."
"Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump ."
"Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can ."
"Ok , I ’ ll try my best . "
"... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast ."
"Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City !"
"What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ?"
"Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark ."
"It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ?"
"Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees ."
"You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one !"
"That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . "
"He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know ."
"You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ?"
"No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . "
"Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?"
"I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting ."
"So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? "
"Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card ."
"Sure , let me give you an application . You can fill it out right here at the counter ."
"OK , here it is ."
"Let me take a look at this for you . May I have your driver's license , please ?"
"Here's my license and form ."
"You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ?"
"Yes , I know what to do ."
"The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout ."
"OK ."
"Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . "
"Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job ."
"Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job ."
"Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ?"
"That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch ."
"So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ?"
"Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits ."
"Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ?"
"Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care ."
"That ’ s a great employment benefit !"
"Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! "
"Harry , do you like the opera ?"
"No , not really ."
"Why is that ? It is called real art ."
"Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves ."
"Yeah , that makes sense . "
"how did you do on your BELTS exam ?"
"fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight ."
"that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ?"
"yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa ."
"do you know where the visa office is ?"
"no ."
"it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop ."
"that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ?"
"have you ever gone abroad before ?"
"yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan ."
"have you ever been denied a visa before ?"
"never ."
"that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ?"
"no , I want to come back to China after I graduate ."
"that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ?"
"I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying ."
"I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want ."
"that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . "
"Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ?"
"I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ?"
"Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ?"
"No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ?"
"I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ?"
"I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles ."
"Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast ."
"Have you been to California ?"
"Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast ."
"How many kids do you have ?"
"Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now ."
"Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . "
"I dislike Susan . She is always above herself ."
"Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ?"
"What of it ?"
"Sure . "
"Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?"
"No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I ’ m returning these books ."
"Let me have them ."
"Here are all of them ."
"These books are two weeks late ."
"I didn ’ t have time to return them ."
"You ’ re going to have to pay late fees ."
"How much ?"
"25 cents a day ."
"25 cents a day ?"
"That means 25 cents for each late book ."
"That ’ s expensive . "
"What shall we do after the volleyball match ?"
"How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym ."
"That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family ."
"Me , too . What did you have in mind ?"
"I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must ."
"I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan , Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?"
"The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive ."
"Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?"
"I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now ."
"Any other ideas ?"
"There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts ."
"It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . "
"Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations !"
"Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . "
"Who's that old lady trimming the trees ?"
"She's my grandma ."
"She looks very healthy.How old is she ?"
"92 . "
"What do you think are the main causes of war today ?"
"I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force ."
"It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country ."
"Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end ."
"How do you think they could be ended ?"
"I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that ."
"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them ."
"It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries ."
"Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive ."
"The problem is that many poor people might suffer . "
"Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ?"
"I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late ."
"What a pity ! The party is very interesting ."
"I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me ."
"Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety ."
"You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . "
"Steven , why are you so depressed ?"
"I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper ."
"What's the news ?"
"According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake ."
"It's horrible ."
"Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area ."
"Yes . How about donating some money ?"
"It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ?"
"Just find the answer through Internet ."
"Yes , let's do it now . "
"I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times ."
"You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ?"
"Yeah ."
"Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . "
"Judy , what is everybody talking about ?"
"Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager ."
"You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true ."
"Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised ."
"Me too . "
"Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ?"
"We are not seeing each other any more ."
"What happened ? Did you break up ?"
"Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time ."
"Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ?"
"I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea !"
"Oh , you are such a dog ! "
"They're very good friends , aren't they ?"
"I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other ."
"Oh , it's unbelievable ! "
"My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry ."
"After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ?"
"She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy ."
"I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life ."
"Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ?"
"No , why ?"
"My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her ."
"She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything ."
"She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . "
"Um , which of them is the better typist ?"
"Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully ."
"Is there any difference in their short hand ?"
"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class ."
"How about languages ?"
"Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does ."
"Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . "
"Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye , Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down ."
"I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times ."
"Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know ."
"Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off ."
"Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness ."
"I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... , Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !"
"You are something else you know that ? "
"Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door ."
"Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors ."
"I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly ."
"This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here ."
"Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors ."
"So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ?"
"We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! "
"Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games ."
"So what ?"
"You want to watch , don ’ t you ?"
"Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games ."
"Please yourself . "
"The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ?"
"Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head , Why do you say so ?"
"He's always confused by easy questions . "
"I can ’ t believe it !"
"What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal ."
"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !"
"Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then ."
"I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure ."
"What were the odds ?"
"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !"
"Too bad . "
"Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester ."
"Yes , of course . I need your student ID please ."
"Here you are ."
"Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?"
"Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology ."
"Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ?"
"Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though ."
"Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?"
"Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy ."
"Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . "
"Is your city a historical place ?"
"Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village ."
"How did it grow into such a large place ?"
"Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre ."
"As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby ."
"Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city ."
"I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?"
"Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too ."
"Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . "
"Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ?"
"Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers ."
"You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . "
"Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ?"
"I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old ."
"Oh you ’ re so kind !"
"Get in . "
"Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ?"
"Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone ."
"Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ?"
"Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here ."
"All information is filled in and now I can design my zone ."
"You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone ."
"Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ?"
"Certainly ."
"( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ?"
"Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . "
"Do you remember Tina , my good friend ?"
"Yes ."
"She just broke up with her boyfriend ."
"Well , that happens . I hope she is all right ."
"But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday ."
"That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case ."
"Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . "
"What time shall I pick you up ?"
"How about 6:30 ?"
"That'll be fine . See you soon . "
"Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy ."
"You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company ."
"Oh , congratulations ! "
"Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages ."
"Yes . I miss you very much ."
"So do I ."
"Have you graduated from college ?"
"Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . "
"Has the train come yet ?"
"No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages ."
"It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week ."
"Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train !"
"Yes , my customers have started to complain too !"
"Oh look ! Here it comes now ! "
"Jenny is going to marry another man next month ."
"Yes , I know ."
"But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much ."
"At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . "
"Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ?"
"Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on ."
"Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ?"
"No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ?"
"I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun ."
"Really ? How many collections do you have ?"
"So far I have more than 500 collections ."
"Among those collections , which is the most expensive ?"
"A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . "
"It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays ."
"Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week ."
"Cool ! What brand , A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart ."
"What about the quality ?"
"Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . "
"Would you like to book a table , sir ?"
"Yes , would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow ?"
"Sure , when ?"
"Six o'clock in the afternoon ."
"For how many guests , please ?"
"Six ."
"How much would you like to spend ?"
"We don't care about money . We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties ."
"OK ."
"How many courses are there altogether , please ?"
"Eight ."
"Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ?"
"Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices ."
"Very good . "
"Did you watch TV last night , Rose ?"
"Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting ."
"What was it about ?"
"Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it ."
"If so , we may live there someday ."
"I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ?"
"Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists ."
"Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . "
"How is your job search going , Janet ?"
"I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company ."
"Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !"
"Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job ."
"I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work ."
"I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted ."
"Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . "
"I went bungee jumping yesterday ."
"That sounds like fun . "
"What are you doing ?"
"What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ?"
"Mumm . no ."
"It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off ."
"What ?"
"The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all ."
"I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl ."
"This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals ."
"Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me ."
"Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good !"
"All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !"
"Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . "
"We have absolute proof that you committed the crime ."
"That's absolutely ridiculous ! "
"There ’ s a letter here for you ."
"Let me see it ."
"What ’ s the letter about ?"
"It ’ s a letter from NYU ."
"Tell me what it says !"
"I didn ’ t get in ."
"You ’ re lying ."
"I ’ m not lying ."
"Are you upset ?"
"I had high hopes for NYU ."
"I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted ."
"Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . "
"The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ?"
"Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year ."
"Are you sure you can do well this year ?"
"I am 100 % certain ."
"According to what you did last time , I have my doubts ."
"I am sure I can get a 95 this time . "
"Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !"
"Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me ."
"What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ?"
"Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies ."
"Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that ."
"You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! "
"I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive ."
"Yes . I dare say it will be ."
"It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed ."
"No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open ."
"But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money ."
"Mmm , you may be right ."
"Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ?"
"No . We couldn ’ t possibly ."
"Why not ?"
"It will be summer . So it will be hot ."
"Is that very likely in England ?"
"Yes . It could happen . "
"Uh ... that's Greek to me ."
"That means they have tapered legs ."
"Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in ."
"Mine are , too ."
"So maybe we shouldn't go out after all ."
"Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! "
"Mary is really a diligent girl ."
"What do you mean ?"
"She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months ."
"She is really something . "
"Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ?"
"Uh ... what game ?"
"Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points !"
"Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ?"
"Football of course !"
"Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals ."
"No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer ."
"Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there ."
"So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ?"
"Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ?"
"Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football ."
"It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?"
"Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . "
"Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?"
"It says a storm may come tomorrow ."
"Oh ! I hate rainy days !"
"Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ?"
"Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C ."
"What bad luck !"
"Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ?"
"Yeah , maybe you are right ! "
"That ’ s really a let-down ."
"Yeah . He really does let me down ."
"But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart ."
"I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . "
"Hey , sorry to be late ."
"What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up ."
"My mother was ill . I had to look after her ."
"I ’ m so sorry to hear that . "
"How annoying !"
"What's the matter ?"
"Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes ."
"Maybe there's something wrong with the program . "
"I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender ."
"That ’ s open secret ."
"But mine could be a lie for his job ."
"How did you know that ?"
"A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi Tina , It's Joe ."
"Hi Joe ."
"How's the weather there today ?"
"It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early ."
"What's the temperature ?"
"It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning ."
"Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?"
"I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow ."
"I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer ."
"Me too . How's the weather where you are ?"
"It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . "
"Mike promised to help us ."
"Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ?"
"Why not ?"
"He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . "
"Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ?"
"I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick ."
"Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it ."
"I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family ."
"Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it ."
"I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out ."
"OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !"
"You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ?"
"Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... , Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! "
"There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday ."
"Which flight ?"
"Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers ."
"How about the passengers ?"
"Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . "
"Did you have a good weekend ?"
"Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much ."
"Oh I see . So what did you do then ?"
"I washed my car instead ."
"Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ?"
"No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . "
"He has worked five years in that bank ."
"He must be an experienced accountant ."
"You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank ."
"Great minds think alike . "
"Hey , check out this new game I bought today ."
"Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards ."
"I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies ."
"Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching ."
"Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films . "
"Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ?"
"The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check ."
"I can lend you some money ."
"Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set ."
"Can I help you in anyway ?"
"You can take me to the bank if you want to ."
"Sure . Let ’ s go . "
"I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me ."
"She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp ! "
"I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up ."
"Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie ."
"Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . "
"When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin ."
"Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus ."
"I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them !"
"I thought you were good at the high jump !"
"No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best ."
"Did you ever win any competitions ?"
"I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ?"
"I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ?"
"Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . "
"May I have an appointment with you tonight ?"
"Very sorry , I am occupied tonight . What about tomorrow night ?"
"OK . where and when ?"
"7:00 in my staying hotel ."
"OK , I am going to the hotel to pick you up . See you tomorrow night . "
"I've just had an argument with Bob ."
"Really , who started the argument ?"
"He did and it's his entire fault ."
"Did you know it takes two to tango ? "
"Hi , Stephanie . I hear you have a new job ."
"Yes , I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School ."
"So how do you like it ?"
"Well , the salary is a little low , but the students are nice . How are things with you ?"
"Not bad . You know I'm an air traffic controller now ."
"Now that's an exciting job ! ! !"
"Yes , but it's very stressful . "
"Tom and Helen got married at last ."
"How did you know that ? I heart Tom ’ s father didn ’ t agree with that ."
"I was invited to attend their wedding ."
"It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it ."
"How moving love is . "
"Give me a call tomorrow ."
"Okay . "
"what did you do over the weekend ?"
"I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment ."
"do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?"
"it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening ."
"like what ?"
"well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start ."
"what else can we do to protect the environment ?"
"if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy ."
"how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?"
"yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center ."
"what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?"
"I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone ."
"I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !"
"to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . "
"What do people usually do on Saint Valentine's Day ?"
"On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts ."
"What will the girls do ?"
"They give chocolate in return . "
"Hey Mark . What are you doing ?"
"Just watching some TV ."
"Anything interesting on ?"
"Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN ."
"So I take it you're pretty bored too ."
"Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?"
"It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?"
"You wanna shoot some hoops ?"
"I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy ."
"Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today ."
"She's out shopping with her friends ."
"Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then ."
"Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?"
"I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way ."
"Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes ."
"Aright . See you there . "
"hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?"
"oh , don't mention it . It was terrible ."
"what ' the matter ?"
"the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone ."
"I see . You simply can't blame the server for this ."
"yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district ."
"that's true ."
"anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?"
"it was good . I brough lunch from home today ."
"you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America ."
"well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy ."
"i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat ."
"yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?"
"you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America ."
"well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places ."
"seriously ?"
"yeah , it's hard to believe but true . "
"What's your favorite TV Program ?"
"I like variety shows ."
"I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor ."
"I prefer a variety show without a host . "
"Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ?"
"Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery ."
"Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems ."
"The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound ."
"Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks ."
"I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good ."
"The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ?"
"It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive ."
"His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . "
"A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine ."
"That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him ."
"He must be regretting about having done the business ."
"I bet he is . He domed his own life . "
"I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue ."
"He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ?"
"It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now ."
"It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . "
"How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ?"
"Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films ."
"We could find a classical one ."
"That sounds fine . "
"How's your work ?"
"Good , thanks . How about you ?"
"Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately ."
"Why ?"
"Because of the low salaries ."
"But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ?"
"I don't know why ."
"Why don't you give them a suggestion ?"
"May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . "
"Good morning , Linda . How have you been ?"
"Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ?"
"No , thanks ."
"Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon ."
"Thank you for your concern . "
"Are you listening to me , Dan ?"
"I'm with you , Jane ."
"What did I just say ?"
"Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part ."
"Just what I thought ! "
"Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me !"
"Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ?"
"I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet !"
"What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !"
"I know . I know !"
"Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !"
"You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !"
"Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . "
"Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?"
"I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday ."
"How come ?"
"It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't ."
"I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?"
"Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . "
"The teacher just canceled the test ."
"Are you kidding ? "
"Would you go to the bookstore with me ?"
"It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go ."
"Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ?"
"Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels ."
"So what are you interested in ?"
"Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian ."
"I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular ."
"Yes . I can lend you some ."
"Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . "
"I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday ."
"Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?"
"All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers ."
"Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive !"
"Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you ."
"Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring ."
"It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week ."
"But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?"
"Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?"
"Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first ."
"Oh , I know . Thank you . "
"Which kind of sport do you like to watch ?"
"Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV ."
"So you must like NBA game ."
"Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA ."
"What kind of sport do you like to participate in ?"
"I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ?"
"I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash ."
"Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . ' , How about playing tennis with me ?"
"Good idea . I will take the racket . "
"Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ?"
"Fine , just fine.Thanks ."
"Doing anything for lunch ?"
"Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . "
"what are you doing ?"
"I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper ."
"you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?"
"I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ?"
"I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !"
"Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ?"
"Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours ."
"Did you play a lot of games when you were little ?"
"My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend ."
"Do you still like playing those games ?"
"Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?"
"Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games ."
"Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?"
"No , I prefer to play with people I know ."
"How about mah-jong ?"
"It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it ."
"I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong !"
"I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! "
"I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful ."
"Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled ."
"I hope so . "
"Do you like traveling , Kathy ?"
"I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... , Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving ."
"Exactly . "
"Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ?"
"It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out ."
"Why ? What's stressing you out ?"
"School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out ."
"The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright ."
"I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take ."
"I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other ."
"That will be great . "
"The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format ."
"Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... , The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... , What changes were made from the old page to the new page ?"
"First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... , Great ! "
"Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?"
"Sure , here you are ."
"Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?"
"Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better ."
"Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies ."
"Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy ."
"Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes ."
"I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt ."
"Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' , Exactly . "
"Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ?"
"Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... , Did they mutiny ?"
"Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened ."
"It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them ."
"Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... "
"Hi , John , how was your vacation ?"
"Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand ."
"That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?"
"Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia ."
"Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?"
"A little , but the rush was worth it ."
"Tell me about it ."
"We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us ."
"500 feet ! I would never be able to do that ."
"Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . "
"What did her boss say to you ?"
"He asked me to beef up in the work ."
"Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter ."
"Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . "
"Hi , Tina , it's Joe ."
"Hi , Joe ."
"What's the weather like there today ?"
"It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early ."
"What's the temperature ?"
"It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning ."
"Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?"
"I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow ."
"I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer ."
"Me too . How's the weather where you are ?"
"It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . "
"Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?"
"Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original ."
"Thanks ."
"I can tell you worked hard on it ."
"I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago ."
"Well , it was definitely worth all the time ."
"Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . "
"How about doing shopping this weekend ?"
"What're you going to buy ?"
"Sportshoes.Will you go with me ?"
"OK . "
"I think that ’ s settled ."
"I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !"
"How dare you speak to me like this ."
"Why not ? "
"Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend ."
"Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach ."
"That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?"
"Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there ."
"So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously ."
"I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down ."
"Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?"
"I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees ."
"It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that ."
"It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . "
"OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ?"
"The brain !"
"That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ?"
"The heart !"
"Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ?"
"The stomach and intestines !"
"Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ?"
"Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder !"
"Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed ."
"So what do these organs do , teacher ?"
"Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . "
"It's not good for business recently ."
"Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities ."
"Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . "
"Do you know how to play go ?"
"It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory ."
"But I heard it is very difficult to play ."
"It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . "
"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one ."
"That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too ."
"Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients ."
"Did you buy new cupboards too ?"
"No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added ."
"I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils ."
"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over ."
"Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food ."
"Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket ."
"I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! "
"Hi , Dave . This is Zina ."
"Zina ? Zina the Snake ?"
"I got your e-mail a couple of months back ."
"Yeah ? Which one was that ?"
"The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep ."
"Right . That one . Did it work ? "
"Can I use your laptop for a while ?"
"Sure , go ahead ."
"Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ?"
"Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around ."
"Oh my , no internet access is killing me ."
"Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like ."
"No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends ."
"Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation ."
"What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me ."
"Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web ."
"That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy ."
"Then , you're probably addicted . "
"Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking ."
"I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?"
"I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much ."
"I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight ."
"It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy ."
"You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . "
"Tell me something about your Valentine's Day ."
"Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return ."
"So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun ."
"Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? "
"Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall ."
"Yeah , I've been there twice ."
"Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ?"
"Oh , it's fantastic ."
"Where did you go ?"
"On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto ."
"What did you think of Tokyo ?"
"Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too ."
"Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds !"
"And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive ."
"And how about Kyoto ?"
"Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city ."
"How was the weather ?"
"I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity ."
"Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! "
"Where do you live now ?"
"I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities ."
"Which street do you live on ?"
"I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . "
"Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ?"
"Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ?"
"Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work ."
"I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ?"
"Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good ."
"Which one is that ?"
"You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door ."
"Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good ."
"Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?"
"What time ?"
"At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation ."
"That's good . See you on Friday . "
"Did you like the play ?"
"Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either ."
"You're absolutely right . The acting could be better ."
"To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . "
"Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?"
"I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out ."
"What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ?"
"Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st ."
"That's fine . I want 2 tickets . "
"Does Tom drink a lot ?"
"Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table ."
"That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . "
"What ’ s your schedule like this year ?"
"Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year ."
"What ’ s your major ?"
"I ’ m majoring in French literature ."
"Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long ."
"That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week ."
"When is it due ?"
"Next Monday !"
"Remind me never to sign up for that course ! "
"Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ?"
"Yeah , I know ."
"I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . "
"Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house ."
"I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself !"
"That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent ."
"It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own ."
"They see their independence as a kind of character strength ."
"Sometimes they are too independent . "
"How are you making out ?"
"I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself ."
"I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift ."
"Don't mention it . "
"How did you meet your girlfriend ?"
"I met Amanda through a friend ."
"That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?"
"We started dating right away . "
"Wedding rings !"
"Oh , no ... , Aren't they cool ? I like the settings ."
"Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ?"
"No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ?"
"Women are such dreamers ."
"These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! "
"I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ?"
"Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ?"
"Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ?"
"Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ?"
"Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ?"
"Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ?"
"No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ?"
"The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ?"
"Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ?"
"Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ?"
"No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ?"
"Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . "
"I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it ."
"He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you ."
"Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me ."
"Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . "
"Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?"
"I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday ."
"How come ?"
"It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't ."
"I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?"
"Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . "
"My uncle passed away last night ."
"My condolences . "
"Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?"
"Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ?"
"I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind ."
"Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ ."
"Why ? You seem pretty sure about it ."
"Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life ."
"But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it ."
"That's why people's achievement varies greatly ."
"That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them ."
"Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ?"
"I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives ."
"Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ?"
"Just as Forrest ?"
"Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ ."
"I got it . "
"How's business ?"
"So so . "
"Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick ."
"Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything ."
"Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back ."
"I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative ."
"I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage ."
"You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore , Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings ."
"Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories ."
"Love stories ? More like one-night-stands ."
"Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints ."
"My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?"
"You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . "
"Which language do you speak ?"
"Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ?"
"Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet ."
"How do you find studying a language on the internet ?"
"It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good ."
"I bet you find the character difficult to write !"
"Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me ."
"So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ?"
"Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?"
"In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . "
"Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?"
"I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market ."
"So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?"
"Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home ."
"How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad ."
"I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship ."
"It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... "
"It's hard to get tickets for the movie ."
"Did you get any ?"
"Yeah , two at the tenth rows ."
"How much is the ticket ?"
"3.5 dollars each . "
"I think Andy's party will be fun ."
"Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something ."
"What's that ?"
"Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?"
"Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?"
"My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . "
"Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy ."
"I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies ."
"Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ?"
"They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts !"
"I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . "
"Where is Tom ?"
"He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep ."
"What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?"
"He ran four miles and came back dead beat ."
"Oh , I see . "
"Hi , Ann ."
"Hi . You look excited . What's happening ?"
"I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days ."
"And you're planning to enter ?"
"Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice ."
"Is there a prize ?"
"I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio ."
"Do you think you have a chance ?"
"A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful ."
"But you haven't practised all that much ."
"I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag !"
"Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help ."
"Yeah , maybe . "
"I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little ."
"That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ?"
"Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?"
"Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it ."
"I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . "
"What day is today ?"
"Today is Thursday ."
"What's the date today ?"
"Today is May first , 2003 ."
"Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ?"
"Well , I don't think so . "
"You know John ?"
"Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper ."
"And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam ."
"I wish he could too ."
"How ’ s your boy , Jack ?"
"He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up ."
"Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ?"
"Good luck to them . "
"What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ?"
"To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them ."
"You're becoming a real television watcher ."
"A lot of people feel the same way . "
"May I invite you for a dance ?"
"With pleasure ."
"You dance well . Do you breakdance ?"
"Me , what brought that on ?"
"There's a story about breakdancing in the paper ."
"What does it say ?"
"According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style ."
"Like disco ?"
"Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance ."
"And disco a kind of nightclub ."
"Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... , So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether ."
"You are witty . "
"Guess who I saw yesterday ?"
"I don't know . Who ?"
"Avril Lavigen !"
"the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?"
"yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... , so you're a big fan , eh ?"
"not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too ."
"and she was in a movie once again , right ?"
"yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great ."
"what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?"
"she looked sweeter than her pictures ."
"did you take a photo with her ?"
"no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs ."
"crazy ! "
"How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?"
"I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line ."
"I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams ."
"If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars ."
"How would you do that ?"
"I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much ."
"I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example ."
"I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes ."
"The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular ."
"That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . "
"You ’ re new here , right ?"
"Yes , I am ."
"Will this be your first year ?"
"No , I transferred here ."
"What school did you come from ?"
"I transferred from PCC ."
"Why ’ d you transfer here ?"
"I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough ."
"Is PCC a good school ?"
"PCC is great !"
"I hope you enjoy it here ."
"Thank you very much . "
"The bridegroom looks a bit nervous ."
"On this occasion , most people do ."
"Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come ."
"She is a beautiful bride ."
"I am so happy for them ."
"Are you crying ?"
"Yes , I always cry at weddings ."
"Harris and Anne are perfect for each other ."
"Yes , they are ."
"You and Tom also make a great couple ."
"In fact , we are beginning to make preparations ."
"For the wedding ?"
"No , no , for the engagement ."
"Try to catch this bouquet then . "
"Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?"
"Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city ."
"I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place ."
"I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening ."
"Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?"
"Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . "
"Is this your brother-in-law ?"
"Yes , he married my sister ten years ago ."
"From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character ."
"Yes , my sister loves his personality . "
"You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?"
"I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday ."
"Where did you spend your holiday ?"
"I went to Paris . "
"Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?"
"Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy ."
"What are you doing ?"
"I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month ."
"What kind of volunteer work ?"
"I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities ."
"Oh , yeah ?"
"Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . "
"Tom , is Jenny crying ?"
"Can you take he away from me ?"
"I ’ m just coming for that ."
"She kept on bothering me ."
"She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ?"
"But I am her brother , not her servant . "
"You ’ re making my blood boil ."
"Calm down . Madam ."
"I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter ."
"I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems ."
"Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?"
"I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out ."
"Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough !"
"If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . "
"How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ?"
"Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family ."
"Oh really ? What did you do ?"
"We watched lots of television and films ."
"I see . Anything else ?"
"Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine ."
"Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself . "
"What's the temperature today ?"
"It's about 5 degrees centigrade ."
"What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?"
"The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow ."
"Are you used to the climate here ?"
"I think I'll soon get used to it ."
"What is the average temperature of Beijing ?"
"lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter ."
"Which season do you like best ?"
"I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . "
"I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that ."
"But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z ."
"However , he disappointed us very much this time ."
"I can understand that . But ... "
"Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president ."
"Me ? Why me ? Why not you ?"
"We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about ."
"And you think I fit the qualifications ?"
"Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate ."
"Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ?"
"Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president ."
"I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . "
"Why are those people crying ?"
"They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day ."
"Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ?"
"Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead ."
"What do they do ?"
"People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead . "
"Er ... Alison ?"
"Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... , I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win ."
"Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... , It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really !"
"Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . "
"I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for ."
"Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?"
"I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ?"
"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere ."
"Which is better ?"
"One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers ."
"I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools ."
"Yeah , sometimes . "
"The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !"
"Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment ."
"On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city ."
"As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health ."
"I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect ."
"What is the greenhouse effect exactly ?"
"It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature ."
"I see , so it's similar to global warming ?"
"They're related to one another , yes ."
"I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live ."
"People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well ."
"People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations ."
"I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . "
"Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ?"
"Sounds good . What should we see ?"
"How about that European movie ?"
"You mean the one starring John Travolta ?"
"Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding ."
"Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday ."
"Okay , see you then . "
"Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ?"
"So I hear ."
"Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary ."
"After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . "
"Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ?"
"The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages ."
"Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ?"
"There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l , Are the reports favorable ?"
"Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a , That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ?"
"Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week ."
"I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them ."
"Sure . There you are . "
"How did you choose courses when you were abroad ?"
"That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor ."
"Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you ."
"Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation ."
"Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there ."
"Sure , very difficult ."
"I am very grateful for your advice ."
"It's my pleasure to talk with you . "
"John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ?"
"Yes , I watched once ."
"What do you think of it ?"
"Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form ."
"I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan ."
"Really ? Good for you . "
"Let ’ s play a game !"
"OK ! How about Scrabble ?"
"No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !"
"OK !"
"Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !"
"Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !"
"Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !"
"Your future husband !"
"Not funny . "
"You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable ."
"I was not born yesterday . "
"Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ?"
"About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything ."
"You know , about David and new boss ."
"Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you ."
"Well , I hear David have been fired ."
"Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . "
"How would you describe your relationship with our boss ?"
"We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot ."
"What do you think his strengths are ?"
"Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . "
"I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it ."
"How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ?"
"It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters ."
"That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ?"
"Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once ."
"If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . "
"So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ?"
"Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand ."
"You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ?"
"Actually it will be my first time to meet her ."
"You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her ."
"That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month ."
"Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast ."
"The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way ."
"Probably you ’ re right . "
"Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing ."
"It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels ."
"There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect ."
"Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes ."
"And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier ."
"You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows ."
"What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you !"
"Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! "
"We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ?"
"Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine ."
"While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator ."
"You sure have a lot of discs here ."
"Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff ."
"To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ?"
"Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me ."
"Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? "
"When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?"
"Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter ."
"How about Sunday then ?"
"Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?"
"Does 6,30 suit you ?"
"It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then ."
"Thanks , goodbye . "
"Merry Christmas !"
"Huh ?"
"I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ?"
"It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice ."
"Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ?"
"Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it ."
"Forgotten about it ? How could you ?"
"Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know ."
"It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian ."
"I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?"
"Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break ."
"Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ?"
"Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . "
"I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members ."
"Really ? Can I join it ?"
"Of course you can if you like it ."
"How can I join it ?"
"There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then ."
"OK , thank you . "
"What do you do in summer ?"
"I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ?"
"I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book ."
"What do you do in winter ?"
"Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter ."
"I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter ."
"Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !"
"Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?"
"Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! "
"Happy new year !"
"Thank you . Same to you ."
"Have you got any plans ?"
"I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ?"
"My roommate ’ s having a party . "
"Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?"
"I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets ."
"How would you solve the problem ?"
"I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes ."
"It would probably be very expensive ."
"I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i , It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly ."
"If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters ."
"Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes ."
"The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project ."
"Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly "
"Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ?"
"No , I'm scared of cats ."
"Oh , but why ?"
"I feel they're dirty . "
"Come in , come in !"
"Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?"
"I thought we were supposed to meet HERE ."
"Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment ."
"I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other ."
"Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?"
"You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie ."
"It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . "
"I haven't met the Smiths for a long time ."
"They have moved to Chicago ."
"Why ?"
"Mr.Smith has changed his job . "
"Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player ."
"Oh , you're welcome . "
"This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it ."
"I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . "
"I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country ."
"Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry ."
"No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it ."
"It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach ."
"Is it just a bus ?"
"Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need ."
"Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . "
"Who's your favorite film star ?"
"Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star ."
"What films feature him ?"
"Many ! "
"My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ?"
"Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year ."
"What happens on the holiday ?"
"Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year ."
"Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ?"
"Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . "
"Rachel has decided to quit smoking ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"You never guess she is going to have a baby ."
"Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker ."
"Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby ."
"Oh , she is going to be a great mother . "
"It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year !"
"I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals ."
"Do you have a New Year's resolution ?"
"I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice ."
"Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work ."
"That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square ."
"Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight !"
"Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! "
"Are you working or are you a student ?"
"I'm a student ."
"Which school are you studying at ?"
"Tsinghua University . "
"I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it ."
"Have you any definite idea ?"
"Not yet , what's your opinion ?"
"I think you'd better try an active job . "
"Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see !"
"Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ?"
"Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well ."
"Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ?"
"He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened ."
"Oh yeah ?"
"Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... , Ha ha , really ?"
"Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! "
"Hey , Jack , where's your car ?"
"I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one ."
"Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ?"
"Jump in , I'll give you a ride ."
"Ok . Boy , this looks expensive ."
"Yeah , it costed a bundle alright ."
"Wow , this's sinking a hole ."
"Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned ."
"I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails ."
"We are on the high way . I'm the * * ."
"Wow , this car can really burn rubber ."
"It's a great feeling ."
"You made a perfect choice , Jack ."
"Thanks , Daisy . "
"What's your email address ?"
"It's bulldog 123 ."
"Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ?"
"Yes ."
"No . That's incomplete ."
"What do you mean ?"
"What's your mailing address ?"
"456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 ."
"That's correct ."
"So what's the problem ?"
"Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code ."
"Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . "
"I ’ d love to have my own farm ."
"It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?"
"I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy ."
"Running a farm would be totally different to you current job ."
"That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office ."
"You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into ."
"My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields ."
"Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . "
"We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?"
"no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?"
"what about a factory tour ?"
"you mean visit a factory ?"
"yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry ."
"good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?"
"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour ."
"really ? What do the companies do that for ?"
"I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known ."
"oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors ."
"exactly ."
"do we need an appointment beforehand ?"
"I'll call the tourist information centre to check . "
"Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty ."
"How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same ."
"The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now ."
"Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ?"
"Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes ."
"I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?"
"Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you ."
"If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . "
"What are you guys doing ?"
"Just having a chat . "
"Morning , Tom ."
"Hi , Mary ."
"You seem to be in a hurry ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute ."
"Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then ."
"Right . I ’ ll see you later ."
"See you later . "
"Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?"
"How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it ."
"It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke ."
"Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate ."
"What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in ."
"What about the Yen ?"
"Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! "
"Can you name some festivals of religious nature ?"
"Yes , such as Christmas and Easter ."
"What about historic festivals ?"
"Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . "
"I wonder how Sarah and Mat are ."
"Don't you know they've already broken up ?"
"I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane ."
"And he's so handsome . "
"Where's Bob ?"
"It seems like he's not coming ."
"Can you give him a call on his mobile ?"
"Sure . "
"Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?"
"Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip ."
"I guess I need all of them ."
"Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home ."
"I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time ."
"Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . "
"Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?"
"Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures ."
"I feel they all talk and behave in a different way ."
"They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys ."
"Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?"
"She is certainly not my kind of girl ."
"Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes ."
"You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either ."
"I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' "
"You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?"
"I attend an aerobic class three times a week ."
"Aren't you tired ?"
"No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . "
"John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ?"
"Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it ."
"I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk ."
"Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ?"
"I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day ."
"You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up ."
"Thanks , I will . "
"Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ?"
"Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up ."
"You are kidding , but she's so helpful ."
"Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you ."
"Come on . She's like that with everyone ."
"I don't think so actually . She never even says "" hello "" to me . "
"Great party , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yeah , really ."
"By the way , my name is Liu Wei ."
"Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you ."
"What do you do , Susan ?"
"Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ?"
"I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . "
"What a pin-up she is !"
"Can you imagine she's over forty ?"
"That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure ."
"Absolutely.She ' s a teacher of aerobics . "
"Do you have spare time tonight ?"
"What's the matter ?"
"There will be a live show of football tonight ."
"What teams are playing tonight ?"
"AC Milan versus Real Madrid ."
"That will be a tough match , right ?"
"Absolutely ."
"What are we waiting for ? It's already 7 pm now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now ."
"Great idea ! Here we go ! "
"Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ?"
"You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit ."
"How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?"
"He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon ."
"Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here ."
"You think he might stay even longer ? !"
"Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated !"
"That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! "
"What ’ s wrong with it ?"
"It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 ."
"It sounds too bad . What will you do ?"
"Mike suggests me to return it ."
"That ’ s what I want to say . "
"What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?"
"I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me ."
"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows ."
"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done ."
"You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . "
"Do you like tea ?"
"Yes , but I don't know much about it ."
"Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on ."
"My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma ."
"Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . "
"David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?"
"I ’ m not in the mood ."
"Why are you feeling depressed ?"
"I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down ."
"I don ’ t think she will do such a thing ."
"But she did and made me disappointed ."
"Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything ."
"But she means a lot to me ."
"Then forgive her mistake . "
"This small town has many serious problems ."
"What's the cause ?"
"The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions ."
"I see why it lags behind other towns . "
"You missed the film.That ' s a shame ."
"Is it stimulating ?"
"Yes . I got very excited ."
"I hope I still have chances . "
"Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ?"
"Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program ."
"What would you like to know ?"
"I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ?"
"Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects ."
"How do I sign up ?"
"If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms ."
"Great ! "
"Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?"
"Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course ."
"Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses ."
"Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors ."
"Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school ."
"That's a problem . "
"Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love ."
"Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ?"
"To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular ."
"That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ?"
"After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with ."
"Sounds like a lot of work !"
"Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . "
"Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ?"
"I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 ."
"So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day ."
"What will you do on Teachers ' Day ?"
"I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ?"
"I intend to invite him to dinner . "
"I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine ."
"Does it work ?"
"I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines ."
"Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner ."
"Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . "
"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?"
"Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !"
"Why are they all in glass boxes ?"
"For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air ."
"So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?"
"No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box ."
"I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?"
"Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time ."
"Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV ."
"It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! "
"So what kind of music turns you on ?"
"Rock'n'Roll , I guess ."
"You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?"
"Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . "
"Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen ."
"I had to go get a cavity filled today ."
"Did it hurt ?"
"I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me !"
"How long were you in the chair ?"
"It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots ."
"Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth ."
"No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous !"
"Don't you have a dental insurance ?"
"I do , but it still does not cover everything . "
"What are you doing ?"
"I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class ."
"There are no countries marked on the map ."
"No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world ."
"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny ."
"I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall ."
"Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon ."
"The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate ."
"It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . "
"What are you up to tonight , Steve ?"
"I'm going to a disco with my friends ."
"That sounds like fun . Have a good time . "
"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance ."
"John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom ."
"I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning ."
"Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ?"
"Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight ."
"I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families ."
"I think you ’ re right ! "
"Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A , It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca , There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect ."
"Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes , And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier ."
"You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some , What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you !"
"Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! "
"What do you think about studying in the U . S . ?"
"Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus ."
"Do you have any advice ?"
"I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security ."
"Anything else ?"
"Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus ."
"I will think over your advice ."
"Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck !"
"I really appreciate your help . "
"Who is that guy ?"
"It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive !"
"Really ? He is my type ."
"He is everybody's type ."
"What position does he play ?"
"Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan !"
"Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement ."
"Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now ."
"Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer ."
"That is not true . They are just jealous of him !"
"Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart ."
"You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow ."
"By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ?"
"You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders ."
"Oh , My chance is slim then . "
"Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack ."
"Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... , Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain ."
"Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . "
"Where's your hometown ?"
"Shandong . "
"Bob is really handsome ."
"That's why he's very popular among girls ."
"I wish I were just as handsome ."
"You are ! "
"How's your new work , Carl ?"
"A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon ."
"Good for you ."
"I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday ."
"Well , you have to take the bad with the good ."
"I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . "
"What he said disappointed me ."
"What did he say ?"
"He advised me to change to a more suitable course ."
"Why ?"
"He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women ."
"It is stupid to say so . "
"What do you think is harder , reading or writing ?"
"Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active ."
"I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?"
"In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page ."
"Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !"
"A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?"
"I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it ."
"Exactly ."
"So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?"
"They ’ re both harder than reading or writing ."
"In what way ?"
"Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English ."
"You are making me feel really discouraged ."
"I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! "
"You look happy ."
"I am happy . I just bought a new car ."
"Wow ! Is it a good car ?"
"It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast ."
"Was it expensive ?"
"Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap ."
"What colour is it ?"
"It ’ s red and black . "
"Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 ."
"Fine , I'll take a taxi ."
"Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening ."
"Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk ."
"Ha-ha , see you then . "
"The boy threw up ."
"That's disgusting . "
"Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me !"
"What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack ."
"Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son !"
"Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like ."
"That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people ."
"That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !"
"Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky ."
"Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod ."
"Now that ’ s a great idea ! "
"Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ?"
"Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ?"
"No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter ."
"Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes ."
"What's the temperature today anyway ?"
"I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . "
"Good evening , Mr.Brown ."
"Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come ."
"It's nice of you to invite us . "
"Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat ."
"Fine with me , but no more chafing dish ."
"Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner ."
"I'd love to try some snacks ."
"( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ?"
"Kebabs and roast squid ."
"Can I have a bite ?"
"Help yourself ."
"Super ! "
"Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus ."
"Why ? Did you open an attachment ?"
"Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes ."
"I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential ."
"I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys ."
"Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! "
"Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information ."
"Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day ."
"It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines ."
"Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ?"
"Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin ."
"I like to read Fortune ."
"Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too ."
"Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases ."
"A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc ."
"But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect ."
"You are right about that . "
"Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field ."
"Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force ."
"Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives ."
"Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . "
"I hope the host team loses ."
"That all depends on how the visiting team shapes ."
"According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America ."
"But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . "
"Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married !"
"Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple !"
"I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night ."
"You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party ."
"Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top ."
"Well , I don ’ t know ."
"Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !"
"Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! "
"Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world ."
"I just don ’ t find it very interesting ."
"I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event ."
"I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries ."
"I think the Olympics help to promote world peace ."
"I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other ."
"You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete ."
"Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics ."
"Now there we are in agreement ! "
"You have a lovely house , Jack ."
"Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately ."
"That's too bad . What problems are you having ."
"Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over ."
"I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?"
"Go right ahead ."
"Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room , Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions ."
"You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . "
"What are you hiding in your coat pocket ?"
"It's a camera ."
"You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ?"
"Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera ."
"What's that supposed to mean ?"
"Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . "
"My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year ."
"That sounds great ! "
"Hi , Sue . What's up ?"
"Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ?"
"Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently ."
"Really ? What's he been doing ?"
"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now ."
"Are you ? What are you busy with ?"
"Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . "
"Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend ."
"Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach ."
"That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?"
"Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there ."
"So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously ."
"I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down ."
"Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?"
"I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees ."
"It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that ."
"It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . "
"Jenny , are you having fun here ?"
"Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines ."
"I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it ."
"Thank you for the invitation ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?"
"Yes , please . Thank you for everything . "
"Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ?"
"Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there ."
"Thanks ."
"Are you applying to study or work abroad ?"
"I want to study abroad ."
"What do you want to study ?"
"I hope to study English Literature ."
"Have you got your visa yet ?"
"Not yet . I have an interview with a visa official today ."
"I see.Is it your first interview ?"
"No , I ’ Ve already been here for 3 interviews . "
"It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas ."
"So the reform can not be carried out well ."
"The government is making efforts to change situation ."
"Easier said than done . "
"Jane , what do think about this dinner ?"
"Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . "
"Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ?"
"Well , Mr . King is singing ."
"Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ?"
"He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails ."
"And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ?"
"She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK ."
"What ’ s happening ?"
"The ladder ’ s falling ?"
"What ’ s Mr . King doing ?"
"He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King ."
"And is she helping him ?"
"No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell ."
"Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . "
"Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ?"
"Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ?"
"That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them ."
"Matinee or evening ?"
"Evening ."
"Circle or stalls ?"
"Stalls ."
"Wonderful , I'll go with you . "
"Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good ."
"What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually ."
"It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead ."
"I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed ."
"What did the critic say ?"
"He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it ."
"The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready ."
"Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results ."
"I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . "
"I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?"
"It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance ."
"Who was the conductor ?"
"Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants ."
"Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist ."
"Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone ."
"Obviously you did enjoy the concert ."
"Yes , I did . "
"All the routine work really browns me off ."
"Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started ."
"I wish I hadn't chosen this job . "
"Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project ."
"Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around . "
"On Saturday night I ’ m going to have a small get-together ."
"Good ."
"Would you like to come ?"
"Do you mean this Saturday ?"
"Yes , this coming Saturday ."
"Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear that ."
"Yeah , that ’ s too bad ."
"Well , perhaps , another time . "
"Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ?"
"Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months ."
"Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ?"
"You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too ."
"Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ?"
"I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players ."
"Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . "
"Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson ."
"Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri ."
"Good to meet you , Mr Chettri ."
"Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . "
"Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat ."
"Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !"
"Thank you ."
"Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?"
"Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library ."
"Excuse me ?"
"Let me show you the way . Please follow me ."
"Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you ."
"My pleasure ."
"This is it ?"
"It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . "
"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?"
"I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills ."
"Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are ."
"At least you know what American women generally like in a man ."
"Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard ."
"American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances ."
"No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants ."
"You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise ."
"Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . "
"What's your new girlfriend like ?"
"Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages ."
"Does she know how to speak Spanish ?"
"She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese ."
"Wow ! ! !"
"And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball ."
"That's terrific !"
"But there's one thing she's not good at ."
"What's that ?"
"She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! "
"Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... , Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner ."
"Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ?"
"That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy ."
"And when do you prepare for your final exam ?"
"Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam ."
"Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ?"
"Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them ."
"Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart !"
"But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late ."
"Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?"
"Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . "
"What's today's date ?"
"It's January . "
"You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ?"
"I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London ."
"What was your childhood like ?"
"I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me ."
"Where did you go to university ?"
"My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication ."
"What is your current occupation ?"
"I am a journalist . I write for China Daily ."
"Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ?"
"No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge ."
"Do you like your current job ?"
"Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . "
"Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see !"
"Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ?"
"Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now ."
"Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ?"
"Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?"
"Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count ."
"That sounds smart ... but kind of boring ."
"Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends ."
"That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ?"
"Definitely pre-med . What about you ?"
"I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run !"
"OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you !"
"Yeah , you too ! "
"It ’ s over ."
"What is over ?"
"Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... , Any reasons ?"
"The cause is another boy ."
"Oh , that ’ s too bad . "
"How did you do on your BELTS exam ?"
"Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight ."
"That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ?"
"Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa ."
"Do you know where the visa office is ?"
"No ."
"It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . "
"We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory !"
"Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading , That is preposterous !"
"You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong !"
"I am not wrong ! The chicken came first !"
"No ! The egg came first ! "
"Did you lock the doors ?"
"All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk ."
"Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat ."
"Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month ."
"Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight ."
"Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . "
"Have you ever played Making ?"
"Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game ."
"Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master ."
"Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself ."
"It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . "
"What do you do in your spare time ?"
"I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music ."
"What kinds of sports do you like ?"
"I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball ."
"Who is your favorite author ?"
"I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation ."
"Are you a music lover ?"
"Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works ."
"What kinds of films do you enjoy ?"
"I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . "
"Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ?"
"I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games ."
"How do you spend your spare time ?"
"I usually read or entertain myself ."
"What kind of books are you interested in ?"
"My favorite books are those about detectives ."
"Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ?"
"When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance . "
"It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable ."
"That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me ."
"I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all ."
"That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . "
"I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ?"
"Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season ."
"Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees !"
"That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees ."
"Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox ."
"Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . "
"Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ?"
"Yes ."
"Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch ."
"No problem . What should I bring ?"
"I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . "
"So , are you enjoying the performance so far ?"
"Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ?"
"I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though ."
"Do you know anyone in the play ?"
"Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine ."
"Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?"
"That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great ."
"So you've seen other plays that he's directed ?"
"Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?"
"Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?"
"I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school ."
"What did you do ?"
"I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ?"
"I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much ."
"Why not ?"
"I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat ."
"That sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . "
"Many congratulations on your winning the game ."
"That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special ."
"You were doing great out there !"
"Well , actually it ’ s just about luck . "
"That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers ."
"Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ?"
"Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader ."
"C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV ."
"Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled ."
"There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play ."
"OK , but they better tag lightly ! "
"Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you ."
"Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already ."
"It ’ s all right ."
"I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting ."
"I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ?"
"Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up ."
"I totally understand . "
"How's your thesis going ?"
"Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done ."
"I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing ."
"Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . "
"I am trying to decide what school to apply to ?"
"Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?"
"I am not sure . What's the difference between them ?"
"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere ."
"Which is better ?"
"One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers ."
"I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school ."
"Yes , sometimes . "
"You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ?"
"I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam ."
"Do you have a clear career path to follow ?"
"career path ? I'm not sure ."
"what kind of job do you want after graduation ?"
"I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... , wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ?"
"I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ?"
"yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal ."
"I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career ."
"no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working , thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . "
"Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ?"
"Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ?"
"I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties ."
"Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money ."
"I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing ."
"You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?"
"Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ ."
"Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish ."
"Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . "
"Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money ."
"Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ?"
"I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates ."
"You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... , Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment ."
"My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection ."
"Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ?"
"I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to ."
"I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places "
"She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth !"
"Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within ."
"Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air ."
"She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ?"
"Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things ."
"They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?"
"Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it ."
"That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? "
"Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here !"
"So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time ."
"If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos !"
"Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families ."
"It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! "
"What is the best place to park ?"
"What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ?"
"I drive a motorcycle ."
"OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ?"
"I am not sure what a handicapped spot is ."
"Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ?"
"I park days and evenings ."
"Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ?"
"What signs ?"
"As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ?"
"What curb colors ?"
"If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . "
"Hi , Mike , what gives ?"
"Hi , Bill , this is my new car ."
"Hey , great set of wheels ."
"You like it , huh ?"
"Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world ."
"It is special , isn't it ?"
"Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?"
"Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years ."
"I can imagine ."
"Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out ."
"I'd love to ."
"Ok , let's go . "
"Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me ?"
"Have you ever been to it before ?"
"Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have ."
"Let's go . It sounds interesting . "
"Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers ."
"Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . "
"Hi , Sandra . how was your weekend ?"
"Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday ."
"Fantastic ! how was that ?"
"Really good ! you should try it sometime ."
"I might . what did you do yesterday ?"
"Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . "
"Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone ."
"I heard about that . It was successful ."
"It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap ."
"I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . "
"OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down ."
"Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb ."
"Your English is fluent ."
"Thank you ."
"How do you think of the weather today ?"
"I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . "
"Hello , Betty , how are you ?"
"Quite well , Tom.And you ?"
"Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ?"
"He's much better today ."
"I'm glad to hear that.Bye ."
"See you later . "
"I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season ."
"That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market ."
"It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?"
"That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it ."
"Certainly . "
"Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie ."
"Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one ."
"Why are we watching it anyway ?"
"Well , it does have a lot of girls in it ."
"True . True ."
"Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ?"
"Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ?"
"Of course ."
"You want something to drink ?"
"Yeah , Got a Coke ?"
"Sure ."
"Hurry , the movie is coming back on . "
"Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic ."
"Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio ."
"Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?"
"Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 ."
"Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall ."
"That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever . "
"How about the matter ?"
"I heard it has been finally settled under the rose ."
"It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation ."
"Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . "
"can I see your passport , please ?"
"is this line for non-residents ?"
"yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right ."
"Ok . Here's my passport ."
"what's the expiration date on your passport ?"
"I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page ."
"I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK ."
"I won't ."
"do you have anything to declare ?"
"no , I don't have anything to declare ."
"how long will you be staying in the UK ?"
"I'll be here for about a year ."
"what is the purpose of your stay ?"
"I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University ."
"where will you be staying ?"
"I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus ."
"how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ?"
"my father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts ."
"ok . Have a good day . Here's your passport and documents back ."
"thank you very much . "
"Going to the cafeteria ?"
"No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ?"
"That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch ."
"Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . "
"I am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this Friday . Please be prepared for it ."
"Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ?"
"Review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson ."
"Any other requirements ?"
"Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . You should know how to use them ."
"Should we remember all the new words and expressions ?"
"Certainly ."
"Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems ."
"Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching ."
"When shall we have a coaching period ?"
"How about tomorrow ?"
"Ok . "
"What do you think of smoking ?"
"It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others ."
"What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?"
"Stop producing cigarettes ."
"But that'll affect the national economy ."
"That's right.But I don't think there are better ways ."
"How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?"
"Maybe it can take effect . "
"Are you ready ?"
"Yes ."
"Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ?"
"The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 ."
"Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ?"
"Can I answer it in Chinese ?"
"No , you can't . This is an English class , and you have to express yourself in English ."
"Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... , Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . "
"wow ! You're going to Tibet ?"
"yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary ."
"that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique ."
"great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ?"
"nothing particular ."
"why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare ."
"oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune ."
"come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much ."
"ok , then count me in . where will we stay ?"
"the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap ."
"then make sure that you book me a room , too ."
"I'll take care of it ."
"and check whether they accept credit cards ."
"no problem . "
"Excuse me , I ’ d like to apply for a library card ."
"Certainly.Here ’ s an application form.Do you have proof of residence ?"
"What sort of proof do you need ?"
"A driver ’ s license or something showing that you live in this city ."
"I ’ m a student from out of state , so I don ’ t have a local driver ’ s license ."
"Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name ?"
"The phone bill ’ s in my name ."
"That ’ ll do.Bring the most recent one in with your completed application , and we ’ ll issue you a temporary library card right away ."
"How long will it take to get the regular one ?"
"It ’ ll be mailed to you within two weeks , but you can borrow books on the temporary card ."
"Okay.Thanks for your help . "
"See you later , alligator ."
"In a while , crocodile . "
"Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door ."
"Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors ."
"I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly ."
"This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here ."
"Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors ."
"So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ?"
"We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! "
"I hear that you are in love with Mike ."
"You are kidding ."
"Don't you hit it off ?"
"Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . "
"Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ?"
"120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ?"
"I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid ."
"Just don't come looking to me for help ."
"Don't worry . I won't ."
"I'm signing off ."
"Have fun getting ripped off ! "
"Have you met John ?"
"Yeah , he came back from America last week ."
"Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months ."
"He must have a good ear . "
"Does your wife work ?"
"Yes , she does . She works at home ."
"Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?"
"Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer ."
"You are really a hen-pecked husband . "
"What kind of movies do you like , Sue ?"
"I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance ."
"Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ?"
"You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say pretty woman ."
"Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . "
"I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks ."
"Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that ."
"Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl ."
"Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well ."
"Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible ."
"I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . "
"can I use your laptop for a while ?"
"sure , go ahead ."
"oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ?"
"yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around ."
"oh my , no internet access is killing me ."
"can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like ."
"no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends ."
"now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation ."
"what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me ."
"well , the term "" discomgoogolation "" comes from "" discombobulate "" and "" google "" . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web ."
"that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy ."
"then , you're probably addicted . "
"so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ?"
"i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work ."
"what are you specializing in ?"
"right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes ."
"that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ?"
"yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little ."
"really ? How did you do that ?"
"well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages ."
"that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ?"
"I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet ."
"when did you take your exams ?"
"about two weeks ago ."
"how do you think you did ?"
"I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous ."
"I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ?"
"You know me ; I'm always studying !"
"don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can !"
"Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! "
"Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper ."
"Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet ."
"I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave ."
"Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . "
"Hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it ."
"Is it a horror movie ?"
"Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?"
"No way . I will be scared out of my wits ."
"That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside ."
"Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ?"
"Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?"
"Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on ."
"That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies ."
"Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned ."
"Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy ."
"The Notebook is this type of movie ."
"Really ? I haven't heard of it ."
"Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it ."
"Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! "
"Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name ."
"Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances ."
"What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there ."
"Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?"
"Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?"
"They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival ."
"Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it ."
"It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life ."
"Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth ."
"Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter ."
"There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ?"
"Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . "
"He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife ."
"Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent ."
"I don ’ t understand ."
"He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . "
"You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ?"
"For me , the times of chatting online has gone ."
"What the hell are you doing now ?"
"I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs ."
"What's new with you ?"
"Do you still remember Justin ?"
"Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ?"
"He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad ."
"Let me see . What a moving poem ! "
"Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ?"
"Sure , I'm looking forward to it ."
"What about your parents ?"
"I'll get used to not seeing my parents . "
"So , how's your work ?"
"Good . How about you ?"
"I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries ."
"But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ."
"But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done ."
"That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go ."
"That's why I am going to leave ."
"But you have already worked there for five years ."
"I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff ."
"Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act ."
"Thank you . I will . "
"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !"
"My first grandchild ."
"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does ."
"Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though ."
"Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does ."
"Well , children usually resemble their parents ."
"It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is ."
"You often like comparing children with their parents ."
"You ’ re right . "
"what kind of music do you like listening to ?"
"I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?"
"yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work ."
"I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music ."
"classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better ."
"really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress ."
"yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework ."
"I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power ."
"you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them ."
"that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier ."
"that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . "
"Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan ."
"I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network ."
"What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone ."
"Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free ."
"Really ? What ’ s the catch ?"
"There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan ."
"So what does this plan include ?"
"Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option ."
"Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?"
"That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... "
"Paul sends you his regards ."
"How nice of him ! "
"What are you grinning about ?"
"Stephany said she would go out with me ."
"I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 ."
"That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends ."
"All of your friends , what are you planning to do ?"
"We ’ re going fishing ."
"What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish ."
"These girls are different , they are not wimpy . "
"Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious ."
"Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones ."
"So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ?"
"Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way ."
"Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful !"
"I hope you are right . "
"Michael Jackson's coming to town ."
"I Couldn't care less . "
"How long have you been in this company ?"
"I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job ."
"You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college ."
"Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee ."
"Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ?"
"It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . "
"Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie ."
"He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie ."
"He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day ."
"A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match !"
"The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie ."
"Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important ."
"My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat ."
"My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning ."
"You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . "
"You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ?"
"Why am I always the last to know these things ?"
"I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ?"
"No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing ."
"How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes ."
"He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! "
"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ?"
"I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program ."
"Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that ."
"Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all ."
"All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram ."
"Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want ."
"That's exactly what I want , thank you . "
"Hi , what ’ re you reading ?"
"Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ?"
"No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ."
"Sure . I didn ’ t know you liked mysteries ."
"Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . "
"Who are those guys ?"
"Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players ."
"Oh ."
"Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !"
"All right !"
"Here comes Jordan , though ."
"Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch ."
"Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing ."
"Which team do you think will win ?"
"The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . "
"How are your parents these days ?"
"Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement ."
"Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home ."
"Sure , thank you . "
"Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson ."
"Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement ."
"Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ?"
"I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . "
"I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt ."
"So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ?"
"How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . "
"Are you new here ?"
"This is my first day here ."
"Are you a freshman in college ?"
"I started school somewhere else ."
"What school did you transfer from ?"
"I started at PCC ."
"What made you transfer ?"
"My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here ."
"Did you like PCC ?"
"I loved PCC ."
"Good luck here ."
"I ’ m excited to be here . "
"Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ?"
"The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter ."
"Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ?"
"We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March ."
"How do you celebrate it ?"
"We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray ."
"That sounds interesting . "
"What are your hobbies ?"
"Sports ."
"Like what ?"
"Basketball and swimming . "
"Guess what ? I've got great news !"
"What is it ?"
"Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?"
"Yes ."
"Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him ."
"Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?"
"She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back ."
"Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?"
"It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly ."
"Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?"
"Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !"
"Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?"
"I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you ."
"I'm really looking forward to reading your column ."
"Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?"
"Sure , where would you like to go ?"
"Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . "
"Who wants to go first ? Allen ?"
"Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?"
"OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys !"
"How about As long as You Love Me ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke !"
"I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! "
"I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ?"
"Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good ."
"I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo ."
"Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?"
"I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders ."
"You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?"
"You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film "" ."
"It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . "
"Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?"
"Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe ."
"What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing ."
"Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion ."
"What am I going to do ?"
"Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . "
"Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect !"
"Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ?"
"Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better ."
"You've gone bonkers , Jen ."
"It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical ."
"OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . "
"Have you finished your work ?"
"Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby ."
"Where is the baby ’ s mother ?"
"She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . "
"Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ?"
"What a good idea !"
"So let's get registered tomorrow ."
"OK . "
"How ’ s your father ?"
"He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement ."
"He can spend more time with his grandchildren ."
"Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world ."
"So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !"
"How do you want to spend your old age ?"
"In the same way , probably . "
"The Canada Day is on the 1st of July ."
"What is its national anthem ?"
"The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' ."
"Can you sing the song ?"
"Yes , I could sing it when I was very young . "
"Could you tell me the right time , please ?"
"Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days ."
"You'll have to get it fixed ."
"Yes , I will . "
"How's your business ?"
"Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it ."
"Things are tough all over . You should never give up !"
"But how can I prevent a deficit ?"
"I think you should make a thorough market investigation now ."
"OK , OK . I ’ ll do my best ."
"I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up ."
"I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through ."
"Yeah , you can make it . "
"How are you , Sue ?"
"Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published ."
"Congratulations on your success ."
"Thank you ."
"And how ’ s your brother ?"
"He is fine ."
"He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?"
"Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa ."
"Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations ."
"Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . "
"God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... , ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with ."
"Excuse me ?"
"Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind ."
"You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children ."
"Why would I spy on you ?"
"Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner ."
"The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner ."
"What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ?"
"Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . "
"Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving ."
"We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out ."
"Out ? What do you mean out ?"
"You know on a date , they are going to dinner ."
"Dad and mom ?"
"Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition ."
"You mean this is going to be a regular thing ?"
"That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? "
"That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing ."
"Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ?"
"You can say that again !"
"What's up with Vince and Elvin ?"
"They work for Zina now ."
"And they're happy with that ?"
"They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . "
"Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?"
"I'd love to ."
"Let's say about 6:00 ?"
"That's OK with me . "
"Did everyone fill out their entry permits ?"
"Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants ."
"Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... , It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne !"
"That's because it's time ."
"Time for what ?"
"It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... , You mean get married now ? On the plane ?"
"Why not ? I've got the rings ready ."
"I don't know what to say , Jack !"
"Hopefully , you'll say "" yes "" ... "
"I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home ."
"Thank you all the same . "
"Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ?"
"Why not . If I were you , I certainly would ."
"But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time ."
"As the saying goes , work value work , play value play . All work and no play make a jucky-dull boy , you know ."
"Em , you ’ re right . "
"Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching ."
"But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so ."
"The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . "
"We must set 1000 dollars aside each month ."
"Why ?"
"We are going to buy our own house ."
"Really ? Congratulations . "
"Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ?"
"I needed some money , so I hocked it last week ."
"You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that ."
"I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that ."
"It sounds like you weren't expecting that ."
"I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away ."
"Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some ."
"Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . "
"So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ?"
"Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated !"
"Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !"
"Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ?"
"Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn ."
"And then what did happen ?"
"Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives ."
"Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are !"
"Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing !"
"Count me in ! "
"What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ?"
"Don't believe him . He's a liar ."
"We cannot expect politics to be true anyway ."
"Exactly . "
"So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift ."
"My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy ."
"That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?"
"Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home ."
"So , what did you get them ?"
"I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems ."
"What ’ s wrong with it ?"
"She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise ."
"Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays ."
"I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . "
"hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?"
"not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements ."
"why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air ."
"I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !"
"Really ? What's the series about ?"
"well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it ."
"it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth ."
"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results ."
"really ? that's interesting !"
"yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good ."
"OK , I'll give it a go . "
"I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !"
"So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?"
"That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !"
"Have you ever written up a business plan before ?"
"Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?"
"You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc ."
"Well , that seems easy enough ."
"Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea ."
"Geez . Is that all ?"
"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !"
"Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! "
"Are you a blogger ?"
"Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years ."
"Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?"
"I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides ."
"What do you usually write about ?"
"At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going ."
"That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?"
"It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks ."
"Got it . Are you still updating your blog ?"
"Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like ."
"Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . "
"What are you doing this Saturday ?"
"Not much ."
"Do you want to go see a movie ?"
"That sounds good ."
"What's playing at the Century Fox ?"
"Candlelight in the Window , Should we go see it ?"
"I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies ."
"How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ , No . I heard that's really boring ."
"Why don't we go to a concert instead ?"
"Great idea ! "
"I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion !"
"Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad ."
"When are you going ?"
"Sometime next month . "
"I need your help , Bob ."
"What's the matter ?"
"I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations ."
"Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look ."
"A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ?"
"ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' , Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ?"
"Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act ."
"Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong ."
"Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' ."
"Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning ."
"Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . "
"Look out !"
"What's it ?"
"You must have rolled over something just now ."
"What you said gives me the creeps ! "
"Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown ."
"How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you ."
"My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company ."
"I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation ."
"Okay , let ’ s make a toast . "
"So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything ."
"Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with ."
"Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill !"
"No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company ."
"What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ?"
"He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company ."
"Must be one smart guy . "
"Have you ever been in an earthquake ?"
"Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over ."
"Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ?"
"I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ?"
"No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger ."
"Where are you from ?"
"I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes ."
"Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?"
"Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room ."
"Wow , that must have really been scary ."
"Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass ."
"Have you ever experiences a flood ?"
"No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !"
"That sure didn't last long ! "
"Is this your brother-in-law ?"
"Yes , he married my sister ten years ago ."
"From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character ."
"Yes , my sister loves his personality . "
"Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God ."
"Do you really think so ?"
"Yeah , you have some other ideas ?"
"Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us ."
"For example ?"
"We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air ."
"Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . "
"You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ?"
"Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting ."
"Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out ."
"It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out ."
"Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . "
"I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager ."
"How did you get wind of the rumor ?"
"I am not a rumor monger ."
"Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work . "
"Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party ."
"Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ?"
"Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing ."
"Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . "
"How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ?"
"Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby , Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ?"
"I like taking photos out of door ."
"Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby ."
"Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos ."
"You yourself have a photo studio ?"
"Yes , simple as it is . t does work . "
"Is there a city where it's always warm ?"
"Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example ."
"Are there any other cities where it's always hot ?"
"Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year ."
"But why do so many people live there ?"
"Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time ."
"Are there any cities where it rains a lot ?"
"Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon ."
"Tell us about some cold cities ."
"In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them ."
"Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ?"
"Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . "
"Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family ."
"Why would that be funny ?"
"Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to ."
"Why ?"
"We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary ."
"I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself ."
"What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless ."
"Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives ."
"What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in ."
"Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !"
"Yeah , yeah , whatever . "
"You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout ."
"I ’ m not crazy about it at all ."
"You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ?"
"I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ?"
"Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it ."
"I hate it ."
"Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes ."
"It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . "
"John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?"
"Sure . Have you checked the weather report ?"
"Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all ."
"I'd like some toast and chicken wings ."
"Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me ."
"Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket ."
"That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it ."
"Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket ."
"Okay , it sounds good . "
"How ’ s your trip going ?"
"Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here , Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ?"
"Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London ."
"I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ?"
"Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern ."
"And what about the number of people on the streets ?"
"Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . "
"Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ?"
"Not really !"
"Why not ? They are very fun and exiting ."
"Maybe , but I think they are just for kids ."
"No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too ."
"Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . "
"Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ?"
"I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime ."
"No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?"
"I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall ."
"You must have a wonderful time ."
"Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?"
"No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps ."
"Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? "
"Hey , the pool's open now !"
"As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer ."
"So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... , ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis ."
"Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans ."
"That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! "
"Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ?"
"Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby !"
"Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man !"
"I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place ."
"Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything ."
"Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ?"
"Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! "
"Is there a lot of crime in your city ?"
"There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime ."
"It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs ."
"That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate ."
"Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach ."
"I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others ."
"That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . "
"He said he will get married by the end of this month ."
"Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet ."
"Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . "
"My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do ."
"You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him ."
"I cannot have the heart to do that . "
"I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans ."
"Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years ."
"I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle ."
"I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you ."
"no-one really believes gossip columnists ."
"I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines ."
"I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people ."
"That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?"
"I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity ."
"You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography ."
"Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . "
"Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ?"
"I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye ."
"Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man ."
"That ’ s why many people look up to him . "
"What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?"
"I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me ."
"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows ."
"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done ."
"You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . "
"Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking ."
"I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?"
"I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much ."
"I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight ."
"It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy ."
"You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . "
"The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment ."
"It ’ s severe punishment , I think ."
"Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood ."
"No wonder . "
"Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?"
"Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave ."
"Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that ."
"Certainly , work always comes first ."
"But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days ."
"Well , keep a low profile . "
"The principal just announced that Dr . Smith is going to take over as dean of our department ."
"Oh ."
"Why are you so calm ? Are you not surprised to hear this ?"
"No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice ."
"Do you think he can do well ?"
"A new broom sweeps clean anyway . "
"Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge ."
"Oh , How annoying !"
"The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible ."
"It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . "
"Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising ."
"That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it ."
"Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?"
"Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ?"
"No problem . See you !"
"See you ! "
"You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ?"
"I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London ."
"What was your childhood like ?"
"I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me ."
"Where did you go to university ?"
"My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication ."
"What is your current occupation ?"
"I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . "
"Hi Amy , you look very happy ."
"Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony ."
"Wow . You must be very excited ."
"I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them ."
"Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ?"
"What a good idea . I'm quite hungry ."
"Me too . I feel very thirsty as well ."
"Let ’ s go then . "
"I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend ."
"You mean you want to stay at home ?"
"Yes , exactly ."
"I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . "
"The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 ."
"They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 ."
"If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final ."
"No way , if it still has 21 . "
"Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?"
"Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course ."
"Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses ."
"Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors ."
"Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school ."
"That's a problem . "
"Hello , Chandler ! How are you ?"
"Fine . And you ?"
"Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately ."
"That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning ."
"Good ? ! For them but not to me ."
"So , what's the problem ?"
"We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner ."
"Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement ."
"Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?"
"Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . "
"The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ?"
"No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ?"
"It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway ."
"I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations ."
"Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ?"
"Now you're talking . "
"I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?"
"It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance ."
"Who was the conductor ?"
"Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants ."
"Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist ."
"Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone ."
"Obviously you did enjoy the concert ."
"Yes , I did . "
"Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss ."
"Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral ."
"How ’ s that going ?"
"It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do ."
"Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ?"
"No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean ."
"I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job ."
"Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . "
"Hey , guys !"
"Hi ! Nicole !"
"How's business ?"
"Great . We can't keep up with the demand ."
"Wow ! I'm impressed !"
"How about you ?"
"I quit my job as a food critic ."
"Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . "
"Shakespeare was born in 1867 ."
"No , it sounds wrong . He was born in the 16th century ."
"Are you sure ? Can you make it more exact ?"
"1564 . "
"What's the score ?"
"The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half ."
"The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final ."
"It doesn't seem to be so easy . "
"what are you looking for ?"
"I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer ."
"do you know what camcorder options are available ?"
"not really . I thought I'd just have a look today ."
"would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?"
"sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first ."
"ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ?"
"it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ?"
"it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes ."
"can you also take still photos with this ?"
"yes , that is an option ."
"how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ?"
"yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark ."
"that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ?"
"It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera ."
"how does that compare with other models ?"
"there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one ."
"I guess you can't have everything , can you ? "
"Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ?"
"Is it formal or informal ?"
"I guess it ’ s formal ."
"Then , you should dress well ."
"That ’ s right ."
"I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you ."
"You are smart ."
"Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions ."
"You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ?"
"The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers ."
"Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ?"
"It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi ."
"OK . "
"What's his job ?"
"He used to be a policeman ."
"But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son ."
"Yeah . He's a private eye now . "
"At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... , If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power ."
"Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... , It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company ."
"I guess I'd buy that ... "
"Did you go to the concert last weekend ?"
"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?"
"Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist ."
"How much was the ticket ?"
"I only paid two dollars for mine . "
"Great ! I landed on Classic Movies ."
"I didn't know you liked old movies ."
"I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind ."
"You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial !"
"Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . "
"Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ?"
"Well , Brad from school asked me out just today ."
"Brad Bush ? Good for you !"
"But I don't know what to do ."
"You mean you've never had a boyfriend ?"
"My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college ."
"Until college ?"
"Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . "
"Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick ."
"Wow , what a great burd !"
"She sure knows how to strut her stuff ."
"She's a real turn-on , alright ?"
"And look out she's dressed ."
"Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded ."
"No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants ."
"Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful ."
"I think you've lost it ."
"Well , that's my opinion ."
"I admit that she is much prettier than Kate ."
"Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly ."
"At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . "
"Do you like swimming ?"
"Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors ."
"Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems ."
"I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch ."
"Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?"
"Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . "
"You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights ."
"Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights ."
"Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings ."
"I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala ."
"You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching ."
"Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products ."
"At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family ."
"As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . "
"So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year ."
"Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ?"
"He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office ."
"Where will it be ?"
"We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea ."
"Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ?"
"Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them ."
"Great ."
"Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile ."
"You seem excited about it ."
"Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team ."
"Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there ."
"Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market ."
"The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ?"
"It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial ."
"Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving ."
"That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it ."
"Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . "
"How are the children doing at sport ?"
"I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age ."
"He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?"
"He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi , Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?"
"The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes ."
"How are they at swimming ?"
"They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape ."
"Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters ."
"I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !"
"I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher ."
"It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . "
"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought ."
"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football ."
"Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?"
"The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone ."
"Wow ! What a hit !"
"Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off ."
"Is he ok ?"
"It looks like it , he ’ s getting up ."
"I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team ."
"The Giants ?"
"Yeah ."
"Well , here we go again ."
"What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?"
"The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . "
"Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ?"
"If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln ."
"He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ?"
"That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals ."
"That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected ."
"And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights ."
"He had great vision , didn't he ?"
"And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . "
"What ’ s your working day like ?"
"I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days ."
"Do you get paid onetime ?"
"No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients ."
"Do you have any breaks ?"
"We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time ."
"My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?"
"There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?"
"Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much ."
"I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . "
"You know that ? Dan got a divorce ."
"Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much ."
"Yeah . But his relation with Sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife ."
"He deserved it . "
"Hello , is Jack there ?"
"Speaking ."
"Jack ! It ’ s Rose here ."
"Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ?"
"Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us ."
"Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ?"
"Is six o ’ clock okay ? "
"Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?"
"Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup ."
"What was that ?"
"Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally ."
"Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back ."
"Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me ."
"I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !"
"He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway !"
"Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set ."
"How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ?"
"Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?"
"Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... , ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... , Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ?"
"Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you ."
"Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle ."
"The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! "
"Whose part do you think is best played ?"
"That of the old man ."
"You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best ."
"Some of the scenes moved me into tears . "
"I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there ."
"Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ?"
"But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work ."
"Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . "
"Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it ."
"You do ? OK , fine with me ."
"Thank you SO much ."
"But I also want ya to do me a favor ."
"What ?"
"You gotta have some better deodorant ."
"I ’ m sorry ? ! "
"When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?"
"Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter ."
"How about Sunday then ?"
"Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?"
"Does 6 thirty suit you ?"
"It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then ."
"Thanks , goodbye . "
"Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics ."
"Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race ."
"He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history !"
"Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ?"
"Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 ."
"I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . "
"Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking !"
"Em , it's delicious !"
"Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much ."
"You're lucky . "
"Guess what !"
"What ?"
"I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend ."
"That sounds like fun . "
"Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ?"
"No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at !"
"Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he !"
"My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... , I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? "
"B , what's in your hand ?"
"Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company ."
"Why do you read them ?"
"As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in ."
"I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks ."
"Correct ! What about you , Fred ?"
"I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste ."
"Don't overdo it ."
"Shall we have a drink someday ?"
"I get drunk easily . "
"Are you travelling in America ?"
"No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business ."
"What do you do ?"
"I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman ."
"I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted ."
"Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ?"
"I am a reporter at a TV station ."
"Do you like your job ?"
"Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year ."
"Which kind of news do you catch ?"
"I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades ."
"Are you feel tired ?"
"Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing ."
"You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter ."
"That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . "
"What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city ."
"I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble ."
"No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ?"
"I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin ."
"Is it a two-pin socket ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . "
"You're my hero ."
"Aw , shucks , ma'am . "
"That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from ."
"Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning ."
"I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today ."
"But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil ."
"A match made in heaven . "
"What ’ s your city like ?"
"It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls ."
"Is the traffic bad in the city centre ?"
"Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good ."
"What about restaurants and entertainment ?"
"There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s , Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?"
"There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas ."
"It sounds like a really exciting city to live in ."
"It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . "
"Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?"
"I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table ."
"you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China ."
"I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick ."
"you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you , a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood ."
"then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you ."
"I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . "
"When ’ re you getting married ?"
"We planned our wedding for next May ."
"Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ?"
"Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project ."
"That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?"
"Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man ."
"Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . "
"I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather ."
"Who wrote it ?"
"Mario Puku ."
"Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ?"
"I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . "
"Tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery ."
"He is really terrific !"
"He was very clever when he was a boy . "
"You seemed to be fed up with Mary ."
"Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks ."
"She is a barking dog . But she means well ."
"But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do ."
"You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . "
"I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue ."
"Is he beating Mark ’ s time ?"
"She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . "
"Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek ."
"I'm not ."
"Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ?"
"I trust you ."
"All right , open your eyes . ( Rose opens her eyes . She stretches her arms , and Jack stands behind her , arms around her . ) , I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ... "
"My uncle passed away last night ."
"My condolences . "
"Nick ! How ’ s it going ?"
"Oh , hey ... , What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ?"
"Actually , my office is right around the corner ."
"It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment ."
"Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion ."
"Sure , you still have my contact details , right ?"
"You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?"
"Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . "
"Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ?"
"Take your pick , Julie . "
"Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang ."
"Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you ."
"Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou ."
"Just call me Miao Dou , Please . "
"And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof ."
"That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ?"
"See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me ."
"You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing ."
"Nothing ?"
"Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that ."
"You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me ."
"Engaged ?"
"Come on ."
"Are you crazy ?"
"What ? I thought you liked Patricia . "
"Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ?"
"Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon ."
"Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ?"
"I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now ."
"It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back ."
"Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . "
"Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ?"
"Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies ."
"They're beautiful . Taylor , you're so pale and skinny !"
"Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet ."
"I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ?"
"I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. "
"Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ?"
"Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too ."
"Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ?"
"I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army !"
"That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet ."
"Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too ."
"I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it ."
"Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . "
"Mum , can I finish my homework later ?"
"Sorry . You know the rules ."
"But I want to watch TV now ."
"That ’ s out of the question ."
"Please ."
"Not a chance ."
"Not even for an hour ?"
"Sorry , it ’ s impossible . "
"Table-tennis is our national game ."
"Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well ."
"I can't , either . I like watching . "
"Listen to this . Mary got married ."
"Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it !"
"Yes . Yesterday ."
"Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !"
"She married Jerrod ."
"You ’ re kidding ."
"She ’ s going to live in Paris ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised . "
"What's your favorite hobby ?"
"I'd like reading books best ."
"What kinds of books do you like to read ?"
"Literature and economy ."
"By the way , would you like to see movies ?"
"That's OK ."
"What do you do in your spare time ?"
"I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes ."
"I just like to sleep like a lazy cat ."
"That's a bad habit . "
"There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month ."
"What kind of food will they be serving ?"
"My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo ."
"It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food ."
"I can hardly wait !"
"Do you know the day they plan to open ?"
"I'll double check the announcement ."
"Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? "
"Charlotte , have you had your supper ?"
"No , I don ’ t want to eat anything ."
"Why ? Don't you feel well ?"
"I ’ m down in spirits ."
"What's up ?"
"My manager jumped on me for my mistake today ."
"You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing ."
"I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well ."
"You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done ."
"But I doubt myself ."
"Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . "
"What do you think of your teacher ?"
"He's very strict with us ."
"And I hear he gives very good lectures ."
"Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . "
"You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ?"
"Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it ."
"It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... , Are you done ? "
"Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there !"
"Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell ."
"Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference ."
"Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations !"
"Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful ."
"That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money !"
"I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ?"
"I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home ."
"Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? "
"What's that , a new video game ?"
"Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do ."
"For instance ?"
"It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer ."
"Wow ! Anything else ?"
"This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen ."
"What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ?"
"Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! "
"So , what happened ?"
"He never came ."
"He stood you up ."
"I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ?"
"Not possible ."
"Maybe , there was a subway accident ."
"Absolutely ."
"A train got trapped underground with him inside ."
"And no phone ."
"And you know , how those express trains create suction . "
"I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike ."
"What's the big deal ? "
"Do you know much about computers ?"
"Not a great deal ."
"I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now ."
"For accounting system and things like that , you mean ?"
"Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris ."
"Yes ?"
"The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets ."
"Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer ."
"That's right . "
"Hi Jane , you look great ."
"You too . Have you lost some weight ?"
"Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it ."
"Not some crazy diet fat I hope ."
"No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before ."
"Good for you , keep it up . "
"On balance , dress designing appeals to me most ."
"Yes , it's to my liking , too ."
"Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?"
"It's my dream . "
"Hi , Sue . What's up ?"
"Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ?"
"Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently ."
"Really ? What's he been doing ?"
"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now ."
"Are you ? What are you busy with ?"
"Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . "
"OK , that ’ s fine . Bye ."
"What happened ?"
"That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move ."
"What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ?"
"The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot , Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP ."
"I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while ."
"Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out ."
"Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?"
"Hehe .. sure "
"Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?"
"I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets ."
"How would you solve the problem ?"
"I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes ."
"It would probably be very expensive ."
"I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement ."
"It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly ."
"If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters ."
"Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes ."
"The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project ."
"Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . "
"Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress ."
"Thanks . Does it suit me ?"
"Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before ."
"I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing ."
"And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously ."
"It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact ."
"Thank you for saying so . "
"Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?"
"It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !"
"Where did you end up going ?"
"Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there ."
"I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?"
"That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?"
"Sure . What's this one a picture of ?"
"Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city ."
"You don't look very happy in that picture ."
"No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !"
"So what did you do ?"
"We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel ."
"My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?"
"Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though ."
"That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . "
"Our major is from a bigger city ."
"He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean ."
"He brings with him some talented people from his former city ."
"I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . "
"What's the score ?"
"The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half ."
"The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final ."
"It doesn't seem to be so easy . "
"I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China ."
"Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival ."
"Why are you celebrating this festival ?"
"We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan ."
"What do you do on that day ?"
"We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China ."
"I see . "
"Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman ."
"It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other ."
"You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle !"
"Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan ."
"It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week ."
"I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . "
"Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ?"
"Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening ."
"That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ?"
"Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ?"
"Okay , that ’ s fine . "
"Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now !"
"Is everything OK ?"
"Just get over here !"
"Come in ! Quickly !"
"So , since when is your house a bank ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows ."
"Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window ."
"What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ?"
"Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis ."
"OK , well , what did you want to see me about ?"
"You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! "
"Reciting texts really bores me to death ."
"Do you have to remember every text ?"
"Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . "
"I want to change my job ."
"Why ?"
"Well , I want to earn more ."
"I see ."
"Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . "
"Do bullfights interest you much ?"
"Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on ."
"So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you ."
"What is it ? "
"There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it ."
"I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ?"
"' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language ."
"I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess ."
"Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ?"
"Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant ."
"Those young actors play the roles perfectly ."
"I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ?"
"No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it ."
"Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . "
"Would you like to come out with me tonight ?"
"Sorry , I can ’ t ."
"Tomorrow night , then ?"
"I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t ."
"I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then ."
"That ’ s sounds great ."
"Ok . How about give me a ring , then ?"
"No . I ’ d better not ."
"Why not ?"
"Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . "
"Hi , Mrs . Henderson ."
"Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ?"
"Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ?"
"The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ?"
"No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ?"
"I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary ."
"Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip ."
"OK . I close my mouth . "
"Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know ."
"What are they ?"
"Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch ."
"Wow !"
"Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves ."
"Two waves ?"
"Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students ."
"And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . "
"do you like animals ? I really like dogs ."
"so do i . I don ’ t like cats ."
"why ? I think cats are ok ."
"I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either ."
"I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting ."
"I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs ."
"I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur ."
"I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute !"
"really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . "
"I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ?"
"Yeah , it happened a week ago ."
"That's a crying shame . It really is !"
"Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . "
"My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that ."
"What does his dad say ?"
"John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . "
"Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave ."
"Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet ."
"I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday ."
"Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave ."
"If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . "
"what's up ?"
"not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though ."
"what's wrong ?"
"I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline ."
"Are you using dial-up or broadband ?"
"actually , I've got a wireless connection ."
"In that case , you need to turn on your airport ."
"I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that ."
"do you like ever chat online ?"
"No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ?"
"Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it ."
"what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ?"
"well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do ."
"what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list ."
"it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com ."
"cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help ."
"don't mention it . "
"You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?"
"Yeah , about ."
"Do you know Chinese better now ?"
"Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone ."
"Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere ."
"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation ."
"A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it ."
"I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time ."
"Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us ."
"Yes , absolutely true . "
"That guy's manner really turns me off ."
"Yeah.He never stops asking questions ."
"Maybe he's abnormal . "
"How's your new car ?"
"Perfect.Couldn ' t be better !"
"You made a good choice , then ?"
"It's just what I wanted ."
"No regrets ?"
"I'm really pleased with it.Thanks ."
"I'm glad you're so happy ."
"It's super . "
"Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light ."
"Yeah ."
"Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed ."
"Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person ."
"It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties ."
"I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen ."
"Then fans don't see you much in public places ."
"Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place ."
"A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' , I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . "
"When do children start school in your country ?"
"Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center ."
"But thats only in the cities , isnt it ?"
"Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated ."
"Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?"
"It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . "
"The baby is crying again ."
"Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop ."
"How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him ."
"OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . "
"Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice ."
"Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet ."
"Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?"
"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !"
"That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?"
"No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city ."
"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?"
"I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs ."
"I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime !"
"It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? "
"My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring ."
"I have an idea ."
"What is it ?"
"You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . "
"You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen ."
"So are you ."
"And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy ."
"I feel exactly the same way as you ."
"Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse ."
"What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either ."
"You don ’ t love me ?"
"No ."
"But we ’ re so right for each other ."
"I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . "
"Good morning miss . Wang , Good morning Mr . Li , It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ?"
"Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed , I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat , Really . For me too . "
"You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . "
"Hi Mark ."
"Oh , hi Stacy ."
"How was your summer vacation ?"
"I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ?"
"I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up ."
"So are you officially a junior now ?"
"Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same ."
"That makes sense . So where is Nicole ?"
"She dropped out of school completely ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time ."
"Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job ."
"It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer ."
"Do you know how much they are paying her ?"
"I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . "
"Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?"
"Don't brother me !"
"Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help ."
"Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault ."
"So , what's the problem ?"
"I drew a blank on the algebra test ."
"No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?"
"Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test ."
"That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester ."
"I'm thinking of dropping out ."
"You can't do that , Jenny !"
"I'm dead serious about this , Sally ."
"Come on , let's talk about it . "
"Hmm , what should I wear today ?"
"Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe ."
"Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ?"
"I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you ."
"Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today ."
"No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic ."
"Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size ."
"OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . "
"I'm feeling hungry ."
"Isn't it time for dinner ?"
"Yes , let's get something to eat ."
"How about Mac Donald's ? "
"I'll be seeing you around ."
"OK.Take care . "
"Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look !"
"What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line ."
"No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me !"
"You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . "
"Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ?"
"Nothing special ."
"How about having dinner with me ?"
"That's great . I would love to . And when ?"
"Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ?"
"No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner ."
"Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything ."
"All right , see you tonight ."
"See you . "
"When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth ."
"You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted ."
"I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls ."
"But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . "
"Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering ."
"OK , boy . I will buy it for you . "
"What a pin-up she is !"
"Can you imagine she's over forty ?"
"That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure ."
"Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics . "
"Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ?"
"Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week ."
"Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ?"
"No , tell me more ."
"Well , I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week ."
"And ."
"And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed ."
"That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica ."
"I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I am returning these books ."
"What did you do to this book ?"
"I accidentally ripped the cover ."
"You will need to pay for the damage ."
"How much do I need to pay ?"
"I ’ m going to need $ 5.00 ."
"That ’ s not too expensive ."
"It isn ’ t ."
"Here ’ s the $ 5.00 ."
"Thank you ."
"No problem . Have a good one . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ?"
"I ’ Ve no idea . Nothing really ."
"How about going hunting with me ?"
"Wonderful ."
"Okay . I ’ ll pick you up around 6 , I ’ ll be ready . "
"I ’ Ve got a new boss ."
"Oh , what ’ s he like ?"
"Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes ."
"Yes ."
"And a white sports car ."
"Um , that ’ s good ."
"Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . "
"Hi , Monica , I got big news ."
"You got a raise ?"
"Not really , just take a wild guess ."
"You got promoted ?"
"Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess ."
"You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please ."
"Ok , I lost 5 pounds . "
"You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol ."
"How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ?"
"Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part ."
"I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him ."
"Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday ."
"Are you a member of his fan club ?"
"I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now ."
"Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?"
"Of course ! I bought two copies ."
"Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? "
"The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned ."
"Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ?"
"I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion ."
"I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ?"
"I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ?"
"I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime ."
"That would be nice . Can you read the characters ?"
"I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character ."
"I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . "
"Jenny , are you having fun here ?"
"Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines ."
"I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it ."
"Thank you for the invitation ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?"
"Yes , please . Thank you for everything . "
"What do you think of the play showed last night ?"
"I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy ."
"Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it ."
"It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway . "
"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator ."
"Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works ."
"I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice ."
"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution ."
"Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down ."
"Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . "
"You look pale , you must have poor health ."
"Yeah . You said it ."
"Why not go to see the doctor ?"
"I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . "
"You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ?"
"There are three of them , the Three Tenors ."
"Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ?"
"Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing ."
"I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song ."
"Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert ."
"Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio ."
"Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?"
"Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 ."
"Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall ."
"That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever ."
"Who was the conductor at that event ?"
"Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday ."
"So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future ."
"The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational ."
"I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . "
"Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ?"
"We need to talk about the size of the country and its population ."
"Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population ."
"It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population ."
"We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ?"
"We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year ."
"That sounds very general ."
"It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one ."
"One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ?"
"Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou ."
"We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? "
"Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ?"
"No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake ."
"You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you ."
"Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . "
"He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee ."
"I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think ."
"Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . "
"I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo ."
"Really ? Are you sure ?"
"Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back ."
"Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot !"
"Really ?"
"Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink ."
"Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something ."
"I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic ."
"Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! "
"Do you often surf the Internet ?"
"Yeah . I do it once a week ."
"Is it very interesting ?"
"Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends ."
"Oh , I'll have a try . "
"Do you think Tom will be elected president ?"
"No , I think Harry will get it ."
"Let's make a bet on who gets it ."
"OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . "
"Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ?"
"You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ?"
"Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat ."
"Great , I like the idea of trying some new food ."
"Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world ."
"Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control ."
"For sure all the customers will benefit from this . "
"What's all this noise about ?"
"They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher ."
"Why ?"
"Because she's not responsible enough . "
"How many people are there in your family ?"
"My immediate family is quite small . It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ?"
"I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents ."
"I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?"
"We ’ re identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else ."
"Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?"
"We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father ."
"I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family ."
"What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ?"
"No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later ."
"Sounds like it was meant to be . "
"It's awfully quiet around here ."
"Yeah . There's nobody in sight ."
"I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here ."
"I think you're right . Let's go . "
"Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?"
"Is there anything good playing ?"
"Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster ."
"Really ? I want to go , too ."
"OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late ."
"No problem ."
"( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ?"
"I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie ."
"Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story ."
"But their love is touching !"
"Ah , you're just too emotional ."
"I am not ! "
"Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?"
"My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country ."
"Is it really completely flat ?"
"Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country ."
"Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries ."
"The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches ."
"That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them ."
"There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes ."
"We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . "
"how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ?"
"I've been having a hard time sleeping lately ."
"as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ?"
"well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful ."
"you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax ."
"you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ?"
"taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress ."
"I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying !"
"you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective ."
"you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class ."
"besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply ."
"that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night !"
"good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! "
"Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan ."
"What is it ?"
"It's a Taiwanese puppet doll ."
"It's huge !"
"Yeah . They're usually this big ."
"The craftsmanship is excellent ."
"All the parts work ."
"Thank you so much ."
"Don't mention it . "
"Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ?"
"The balcony is still available ."
"Aren't there any other seats ?"
"No , I'm afraid that's it . "
"It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys ."
"Yeah ."
"Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ?"
"I have found myself a date mate ."
"You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun ."
"A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . "
"Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong ."
"OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ?"
"Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth ."
"Froth ?"
"If you want something manly , stick with the espresso ."
"Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . "
"What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ?"
"Don't believe him.He ' s a liar ."
"We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . "
"This is my uncle , Charles ."
"He looks strong.What does he do ?"
"He's a captain ."
"He must be very brave ."
"Exactly ! "
"Are you a soccer fan ?"
"Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup ."
"Which team is your favorite ?"
"Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky ."
"I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . "
"Hey Eve , how are you ?"
"I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ?"
"I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy !"
"Do you have a lot of homework ?"
"Yes . Don ’ t you ?"
"Of course I do !"
"Which class are you working on right now ?"
"I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow ."
"Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ?"
"Yes . Are you ?"
"Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow !"
"Do you want to study together ?"
"Sure . This library is too quiet though ."
"Do you want to go to and empty classroom ?"
"That sounds good ."
"Ok . Let ’ s go ! "
"I am certain I am going to fail my English test ."
"Why are you so pessimistic ?"
"Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week ."
"Only for this reason ?"
"Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad ."
"Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation ."
"Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . "
"Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it ."
"He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in ."
"Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties ."
"It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ?"
"What's that ?"
"Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . "
"I go to the fitness center every weekend ."
"What for ?"
"To lose some weight ."
"Why , you look pretty all right . "
"I heard you received a prize for you book ."
"yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards ."
"congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement ."
"actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus ."
"what was the prize ?"
"I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice ."
"that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ?"
"I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz ."
"I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! "
"To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring ."
"To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had ."
"How could you manage to pass the exam ?"
"It is still a mystery to me . "
"I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger ."
"That ’ s a matter of opinion ."
"What do you mean ?"
"I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . "
"And lots of "" Dear Abby "" sob stories ... , Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !"
"No wonder you're such a wacko ... , Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples !"
"Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... , You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? "
"How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?"
"We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education ."
"Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job ."
"But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . "
"I find that every employee here respects that manager very much ."
"Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . "
"It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland ."
"Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match ."
"The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !"
"Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !"
"It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net ."
"Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . "
"I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working ."
"He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep ."
"If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . "
"London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 ."
"I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader ."
"Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain ."
"Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s ."
"She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?"
"There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow ."
"I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too ."
"I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go ."
"Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum ."
"There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty ."
"Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! "
"Can we talk ?"
"Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ?"
"You know what I mean ."
"Yeah . I know ."
"I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... , You know , I think you ’ re awesome ."
"I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it ."
"Honey ... , Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... , Baby , I love you so much ."
"You do ?"
"I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome ."
"Oh , I love you too !"
"Come on . Put the gun down ."
"Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . "
"Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ?"
"Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat ."
"When did you decide to become a vegetarian ?"
"I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since ."
"That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ?"
"Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them ."
"You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ?"
"I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great !"
"How do you get enough protein in your diet ?"
"Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish ."
"Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ?"
"I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it ."
"How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ?"
"That sounds great . What time should I come over ?"
"Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m ."
"Sounds good . See you there ! "
"How old is Keith ?"
"He ’ s 21 . how old is James ?"
"He ’ s a year older than Keith , but he looks younger ."
"How ’ s your father ?"
"He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement ."
"He can spend more time with his grandchildren ."
"Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world ."
"So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !"
"How do you want to spend your old age ?"
"In the same way , probably . "
"Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best ."
"Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport ."
"Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise ."
"I will think about it ."
"Come on ! It is really a fun game . "
"Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?"
"Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?"
"Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable ."
"That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems ."
"Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?"
"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports ."
"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?"
"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it ."
"Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo ."
"Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits ."
"You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too ."
"Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ?"
"For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible ."
"Hey , young man , you are so deep today ."
"I always am . You just didn't notice . "
"It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas ."
"So the reform cannot be carried out well ."
"Government is making efforts to change situation ."
"Easier said than done . "
"How are you going all these days ?"
"Fine , thanks ."
"But you look depressed ."
"I have some problem with my work ."
"Is it serious ?"
"I can solve it , thanks ."
"How about your family ?"
"Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . "
"You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own ."
"If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me ."
"I ’ ll be very glad if you would help ."
"I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture ."
"Thank you . I wish I would ."
"Good luck to you . "
"Wow , is that your sports car ?"
"Yes , do you like it ?"
"I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?"
"Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again ."
"What's wrong with it ?"
"Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive ."
"When's the last time you had it serviced ?"
"It must have been a few years ago now ."
"I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis ."
"They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !"
"What else is wrong with it ?"
"The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !"
"Anything else ?"
"The brakes don't really work that well anymore either ."
"Why don't you get it all fixed ?"
"It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it !"
"Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! "
"Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ?"
"Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ?"
"I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ?"
"Yes , I'm leaving at four pm ."
"Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter ."
"Yes , me too ."
"I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . "
"Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market ."
"Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you ."
"Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ?"
"You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive !"
"Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster !"
"Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? "
"Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary ."
"I am very pleased to meet you ."
"Bob is in advertising ."
"That sounds an interesting job , Bob . "
"Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here !"
"What are you so excited about ?"
"I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !"
"What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman ."
"I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person ."
"There are tons of other paintings that I think are better ."
"Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?"
"No , how much is it worth ?"
"About 80 million dollars ."
"Whoa . "
"Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ?"
"A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . "
"Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night ."
"Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' ."
"He seems to win awards everywhere ."
"He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World ."
"I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' , That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . "
"Hi Jane , you look great ."
"You too . Have you lost some weight ?"
"Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it ."
"Not some crazy diet fat I hope ."
"No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before ."
"Good for you , keep it up . "
"It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing ."
"How did they hear ? No one called ."
"In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here ."
"His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son ."
"And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to ."
"Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now ."
"This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . "
"OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see !"
"Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London ."
"OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ?"
"Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities ."
"Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ?"
"Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound ."
"Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ?"
"Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go !"
"Is that how you feel on the bus ?"
"Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time ."
"So , so you're British , do you missing them ?"
"Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . "
"Is the view going to be ok ?"
"Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine ."
"I ’ ll do my best ."
"That ’ s the way to go . "
"I got a promotion . Lunch is on me ."
"It ’ s great . "
"Which team won ?"
"The Spur ."
"What was the score ?"
"They managed a 99:80 victory . "
"What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today ."
"She is going to get married ."
"No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ?"
"I don ’ t know . "
"I think Bill Clinton is a good president ."
"But he has the sex scandal ."
"Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president ."
"I agree . He is also an excellent speaker ."
"Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t ."
"yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . "
"It's a beautiful day , isn't it ?"
"Yes , isn't it ."
"Do you now the temperature today ?"
"It's beautiful 75 degrees ."
"How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend ."
"Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees ."
"What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home ."
"I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans ."
"That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . "
"Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ?"
"Yes , here you go ."
"Will you be checking any bags today ."
"Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces ."
"I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase ."
"What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd !"
"I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big ."
"Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this ."
"Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars ."
"That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! "
"How are you ?"
"Fine ."
"I haven ’ t seen you for several days ."
"Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week ."
"What ’ s he doing ?"
"He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week ."
"He must be happy ."
"Yeah . How are you these days ?"
"Fine too . "
"So what kind of music turns you on ?"
"Rock ' n'Roll , I guess ."
"You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?"
"Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . "
"Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house ."
"But yesterday you said you would rent it ."
"I ’ Ve changed my mind ."
"Why is that ?"
"Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work ."
"Maybe you ’ re right . "
"You ready ?"
"Am I ready for what ?"
"Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ?"
"Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer ."
"You ’ re not nervous , are you ?"
"I ’ m very nervous ."
"Why are you nervous ?"
"I ’ m not going to know anybody there ."
"That ’ s not a problem ."
"That makes me nervous ."
"It ’ s fun meeting new people ."
"I didn ’ t think about it that way . "
"Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive ."
"Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ?"
"It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design ."
"I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money ."
"Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . "
"I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ?"
"Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course ."
"I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ?"
"Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English ."
"You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ?"
"Right . I only knew a few English sentences ."
"That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?"
"First , I worked as a servant ."
"Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience ."
"I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . "
"What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ?"
"We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results ."
"What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ?"
"From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future !"
"You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?"
"Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! "
"What do you know about Julia Roberts ?"
"Her acting is OK ."
"I mean her personality ."
"I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? "
"So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?"
"Nine total . Seven children and my parents ."
"Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?"
"Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it ."
"Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right ."
"It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make ."
"Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy ."
"That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs ."
"And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common ."
"Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college ."
"Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college ."
"They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ?"
"Nothing . Just watching TV ."
"I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ?"
"Sure . What time ?"
"The film will start at 2 , Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ?"
"In my parking lot , at 2pm ."
"All right . See you then . "
"How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ?"
"Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before !"
"Do you know why that is ?"
"Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . "
"What are you reading ?"
"It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language ."
"It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language ."
"Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English ."
"Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ?"
"The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language ."
"Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages ."
"Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers ."
"In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . "
"Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise ."
"How about taking a walk in the park ?"
"OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh ."
"Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !"
"Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left ."
"Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu ."
"A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . "
"Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking ."
"Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week ."
"Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job ."
"Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! "
"Wei , you look really tired ."
"Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm ."
"9:00 !"
"Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment ."
"Why ’ s that ?"
"Because too many people in the office are on holiday . "
"I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport ."
"Oh , thanks a lot ."
"What time are you leaving ?"
"1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m ."
"What airline and what flight ?"
"Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 ."
"I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m ."
"Ok . See you tomorrow . "
"Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ?"
"You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how ."
"Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ?"
"Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . "
"That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ?"
"Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her ."
"I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered ."
"He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that ."
"Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?"
"I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair ."
"We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself ."
"Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?"
"No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ?"
"Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend ."
"I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . "
"Good morning , Linda . How have you been ?"
"Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ?"
"No , thanks ."
"Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon ."
"Thank you for your concern . "
"Um , which of them is the better typist ?"
"Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully ."
"Is there any difference in their short hand ?"
"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class ."
"How about languages ?"
"Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does ."
"Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . "
"Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ?"
"No , nobody ."
"You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ?"
"Well , to be frank , yes , I do ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ?"
"Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign ."
"Sign ? What ’ s sign ?"
"There , on the window ."
"Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry ."
"That ’ s all right . "
"So , how'd everyone do ?"
"Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ?"
"Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it ."
"Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before !"
"It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood !"
"Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! "
"You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I have been here for three years ."
"Do you like this campus ?"
"Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it ."
"How come ?"
"It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected ."
"Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped ."
"I ’ ll just have to put up with it . "
"I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ?"
"Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips ."
"That'll be fine . Thanks ."
"Do you have any ketchup ?"
"I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . "
"Harry is a hen-pecked husband ."
"No , he isn ’ t ."
"Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ?"
"He is afraid of his father-in-law . "
"Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by ."
"Come on in . Would you care for a drink ?"
"That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! "
"May , is the university a terrible place ?"
"Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ?"
"Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in ."
"Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think ."
"How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet ."
"Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom ."
"Oh , really ? Were you not caught ?"
"Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment ."
"What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ?"
"This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect ."
"I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English ."
"Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make ."
"You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form ."
"Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . "
"Who is your favorite NBA star ?"
"Kobe Bryant , of course ."
"Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense ."
"He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand ."
"Maybe he is not good at rebounding ?"
"Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit ."
"Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?"
"Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him ."
"Well then , what are your spoils ?"
"Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . "
"What happened ?"
"It was just a misunderstanding . "
"I hear little Bob has recovered ."
"That's a great relief . I was worried about him ."
"The operation was very successful ."
"His parents must feel very happy . "
"Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone ."
"Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?"
"No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one , Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two ."
"Thanks for telling me this ."
"I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying ."
"Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again ."
"Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . "
"How did you do in the last quiz ?"
"I doubt if I can pass it ."
"Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict ."
"But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me ."
"I hope you'll do better in the final ."
"I must , if I want to pass the course . "
"I am so bored all day ."
"Why ?"
"Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back ."
"Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . "
"Mike has changed much after marriage ."
"Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose ."
"It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . "
"Do you often go to watch sports games ?"
"I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV ."
"Can you recall the games ?"
"Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . "
"May I help you ?"
"I can ’ t find the book I want ."
"Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ?"
"I checked it already ."
"Do we have it available ?"
"It wasn ’ t there ."
"I guess it is lost ."
"Will you be getting another copy ?"
"Yes , we will ."
"Could you reserve a copy for me ?"
"I can do that ."
"That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . "
"What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?"
"My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate ."
"Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !"
"Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive ."
"Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?"
"I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood ."
"Did your husband's family get to meet your family ?"
"My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family ."
"That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?"
"We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa ."
"You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?"
"Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! "
"Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family ."
"Why would that be funny ?"
"Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to ."
"Why ?"
"We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary ."
"I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself ."
"What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless ."
"Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives ."
"What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in ."
"Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !"
"Yeah , yeah , whatever . "
"How did your vacation go ?"
"I traveled the Three Gorges ."
"What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ?"
"Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting !"
"Did your boat float down the river ?"
"Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides ."
"Sounds dangerous ."
"Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that ."
"What a thrilling trip ! "
"Hello ! How are you ."
"Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days ."
"What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ?"
"That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted ."
"Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job ."
"Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual ."
"Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good ."
"Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along ."
"OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . "
"If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes ."
"Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China ."
"Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it ."
"Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms ."
"Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . "
"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?"
"I don ’ t know ."
"Please think it over ."
"Oh , I see ."
"Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it ."
"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend ."
"Ur , you really let me down ."
"Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory ."
"No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband ."
"What day is it on earth ?"
"It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . "
"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?"
"I don ’ t know ."
"Please think it over ."
"Oh , I see ."
"Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it ."
"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend ."
"Ur , you really let me down ."
"Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory ."
"No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband ."
"What day is it on earth ?"
"It ’ s the anniversary of our weeding . "
"Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ?"
"What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?"
"Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night ."
"Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! "
"I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam ."
"That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . "
"Hello . I'm Jason ."
"Hi . My name is Dolma ."
"Nice to meet you , Dolma ."
"Good to meet you too . "
"How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ?"
"Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon ."
"You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?"
"Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it ."
"Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . "
"Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ?"
"I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope ."
"That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ?"
"Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life ."
"What did it say about you then ?"
"For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some "" unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee ."
"But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science ."
"Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it ."
"For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their "" accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . "
"Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man ."
"Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior ."
"If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver ."
"OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . "
"You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout ."
"I ’ m not crazy about it at all ."
"You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ?"
"I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ?"
"Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it ."
"I hate it ."
"Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes ."
"It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . "
"Did you listen to the weather forecast ?"
"No . Why ?"
"There's a typhoon coming ."
"No way !"
"Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . "
"Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ?"
"I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions ."
"No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows ."
"It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell ."
"Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later ."
"I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes ."
"That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals ."
"Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . "
"The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police ."
"Because it was her husband who beat her ."
"It is incredible ."
"She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . "
"I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?"
"He appeals to the fans thanks to two things , you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks ."
"Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k , In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls ."
"yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout ."
"and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . "
"May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith ."
"Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . "
"Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy ."
"How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed ."
"But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts ."
"Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . "
"That looks like an interesting book ."
"It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on ."
"There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though ."
"They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides ."
"Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before ."
"Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape ."
"TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical ."
"This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval ."
"What sports do they play there ?"
"It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings ."
"Is that building a perfect cube ?"
"According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What , Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . "
"Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald ."
"Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ?"
"He ’ s nearly 90 ."
"Good gracious ! Are you sure ?"
"I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 ."
"Is she really ?"
"Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband ."
"Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? "
"The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year ."
"I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts ."
"Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . "
"Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself . It was really fun !"
"Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... , Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world ."
"Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home . "
"Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ?"
"Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ?"
"No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter ."
"Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes ."
"What's the temperature today anyway ?"
"I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . "
"When is your birthday ?"
"August 1st ."
"Do you usually have a birthday party ?"
"Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me ."
"What would you do at the party ?"
"We sing "" Happy Birthday "" at the party and have birthday cakes ."
"Do you know when people began to sing the song "" Happy Birthday "" ?"
"Well , I don't know ."
"Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called "" Good Morning to you "" . But later someone added the words "" Happy Birthday "" to their tune ."
"So the "" Happy Birthday "" song has been popular since then ?"
"Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . "
"What do you think of your teacher ?"
"He's very strict with us ."
"And I hear he gives very good lectures ."
"Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . "
"I ’ Ve got a new boss ."
"Oh , what ’ s he like ?"
"Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes ."
"Yes ."
"And a white sports car ."
"Um , that ’ s good ."
"Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . "
"Thank you so much . I can't take this ."
"She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it ."
"What did she mean just now about raising pigs ?"
"Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” , Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady ."
"She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly . "
"I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat ."
"Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?"
"Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries ."
"All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better !"
"What are you talking about ? I have salads some times ."
"Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy !"
"Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ?"
"It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! "
"Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman ."
"How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ?"
"No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice ."
"Oh , you've already grown up , son . "
"What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken !"
"I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it ."
"You have a real talent , Ellen !"
"I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . "
"I don ’ t dare to look after the children now ."
"Why ?"
"The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them ."
"It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . "
"Jane is going to quit her job in the bank ."
"You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid ."
"It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . "
"Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting ."
"Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career ."
"Do you mean financially rewarding ?"
"Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries ."
"I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy ."
"Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive ."
"How much do you make ?"
"I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . "
"I just got fired ."
"You asked for it . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ?"
"Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now ."
"I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ?"
"Why not ?"
"It ’ s my treat this time ."
"Thanks . I could eat a cow . "
"Would you like to see our new shirts ?"
"Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things ."
"But they ’ re very nice , you know ."
"Really ."
"And not expensive either ."
"Oh , I don ’ t care about that ."
"Everybody is buying them ."
"Are they ?"
"Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see ."
"I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion ."
"I see ."
"But thank you very much all the same ."
"Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . "
"Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ?"
"Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality ."
"Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each ."
"What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ?"
"We should choose from the backups ."
"That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match ."
"That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle ."
"That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played ."
"Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ?"
"I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before ."
"Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic ."
"Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ?"
"Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding ."
"Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ?"
"Yeah , what ’ s up ?"
"Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ?"
"I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . "
"Hi , Mark ! Long time no see !"
"Hi , Alex !"
"Where have you been ?"
"I just got back from London ."
"How was your flight ?"
"It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though ."
"That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ?"
"It was 10 hours ."
"Did you have a layover ?"
"Yes , in Paris , France ."
"Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?"
"Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you !"
"Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... , It was nothing . "
"I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them ."
"Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround ."
"Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding ."
"Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies ."
"With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board ."
"Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people ."
"Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . "
"Hello , Kevin ."
"Oh , hi , Lee . You look great ."
"Thanks . You too . "
"What's the weather forecast for today ?"
"Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon ."
"Any rain ?"
"No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow ."
"I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . "
"You hurt Ben's feelings ."
"So ? "
"have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ?"
"no . what's it like ?"
"it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through , would you want to live there ?"
"I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro , what's your dreamhole like then ?"
"my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England ."
"would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?"
"old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important ."
"it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ?"
"no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !"
"I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?"
"no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a "
"You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ?"
"Yes , I finished last Friday ."
"You sound relieved ."
"Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams ."
"Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ?"
"Yes , I intend to go to university.That ' ll be in September.But it all depends on my A level results ."
"You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ?"
"Oh , yes . "
"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?"
"It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume ."
"I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that ."
"That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . "
"Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?"
"There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers ."
"Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa ."
"Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food ."
"What is the international community doing to help ?"
"The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region ."
"How many countries have been affected ?"
"Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries ."
"I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran ."
"Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble ."
"Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?"
"So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . "
"Where are you going for your trip ?"
"I think Hebes is a good place ."
"But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms !"
"Really ?"
"Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds ."
"How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ?"
"The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation ."
"It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody !"
"You are quite right . "
"hi , how are you doing ?"
"everything's great . And you ?"
"same here . Have you seen any new films recently ?"
"no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce ."
"oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking ."
"yeah . I found it is so close to our life ."
"it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world ."
"you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years ."
"well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too ."
"I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married ."
"oh , that's too short-lived ."
"that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation ."
"I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage ."
"definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously ."
"in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone ."
"I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . "
"We should keep Frank at arm's length ."
"Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in ."
"He hits below the belt ."
"And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . "
"Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy ."
"I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking ."
"Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good ."
"No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . "
"Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ?"
"Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ?"
"Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . "
"I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ?"
"Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso !"
"I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man !"
"You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting ."
"Are you serious , John ?"
"All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . "
"Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ?"
"All right , if that would make you happy ."
"So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess ."
"Well , nothing really serious . "
"Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ?"
"Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things ."
"Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this ."
"I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them ."
"Yes , that happens ."
"I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall ."
"Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ?"
"No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition ."
"Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet ."
"No , I thought I would take it later ."
"Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later ."
"Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets ."
"Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 , I can take it then . I have that time slot free ."
"Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher ."
"I'll take it then ."
"Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ?"
"I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it ."
"Really ? That's great to know ."
"That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . "
"What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?"
"We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River ."
"How hard is the climb ?"
"It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet ."
"What did you do last week ?"
"We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting ."
"Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it ."
"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb ."
"Yeah , I will . See you then !"
"Ok , see you . "
"How many people are there in your family ?"
"There are 15 people in my family ."
"What did you say ? How many ?"
"15 people ."
"Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ?"
"Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me ."
"But you don't live at home anymore ."
"Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home ."
"My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house ."
"Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis , Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent !"
"My aunts and uncles are all teachers ."
"You are so lucky !"
"I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year ."
"That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time ."
"I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English ."
"800 books ? I'm impressed !"
"My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . "
"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?"
"Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?"
"What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news !"
"Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess ."
"For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?"
"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months ."
"What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ?"
"Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost ."
"Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !"
"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country ."
"We ’ re doomed !"
"There is some really good news though !"
"Really ? What !"
"I got offered a new job ! "
"So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ?"
"I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university ."
"And how do you like working for IBM ?"
"It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot ."
"What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ?"
"I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others ."
"That ’ s good . We always need team players here . "
"Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ?"
"Yes , Ms . Jones ."
"Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class . "
"Professor , where's Canada ?"
"Canada is north of here ."
"Can you show me on the map ?"
"Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States ."
"Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ?"
"Mexico is south of the United States ."
"How about Connecticut ? Where's that ?"
"Connecticut is east of New York ."
"What state is west of Pennsylvania ?"
"Ohio ."
"OK , Where's Los Angeles ?"
"Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco ."
"Where's Boston ."
"Boston is in the northeast part of the country ."
"Where is Las Vegas ?"
"Las Vegas is in the southwest . "
"Is that true ?"
"I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way ."
"Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada !"
"That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes ."
"She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy ."
"Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . "
"Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am ."
"He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack ."
"Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ?"
"Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept ."
"Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up ."
"That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours ."
"Why doesn't he just drive to work ?"
"It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . "
"Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry ."
"Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there ."
"What are you going to play ?"
"Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball ."
"Enjoy yourself . "
"Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !"
"Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red ."
"Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?"
"Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child ."
"But my father did not . He didn't have much time ."
"Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent ."
"Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?"
"Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time ."
"It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?"
"Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty ."
"Can I see the rainbow ?"
"That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . "
"Tom has grown six inches within a year ."
"He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot ."
"Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger ."
"Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . "
"For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?"
"Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ?"
"I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch ."
"Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ?"
"Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort ."
"That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ?"
"As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay ."
"With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian ."
"We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . "
"Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore ."
"But it was her that makes us so embarrassed ."
"I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?"
"I don't care . "
"Guess what came in the mail today ?"
"What ?"
"My acceptance letter to Yale !"
"Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?"
"Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in ."
"You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?"
"Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes ."
"When can you do that ?"
"Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?"
"Sure . What can you choose from ?"
"Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major ."
"What is your major ?"
"I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see ."
"What are the fundamental course ?"
"In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art ."
"Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system ."
"Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system ."
"Really ?"
"oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course ."
"why not ?"
"maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . "
"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?"
"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates ."
"What position do you play ?"
"I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense ."
"Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself ."
"Oh , yeah ? Which team ?"
"The Rockets ."
"Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later ."
"All right , see you later . "
"OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will ."
"Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ?"
"No , I don't ."
"It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ?"
"Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . "
"Good morning , Mei ! How are you ?"
"Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ?"
"Not bad thanks ."
"Good . See you !"
"Bye ! "
"You like movies ?"
"Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax ."
"What type do you like the best ?"
"Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything ."
"I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it ."
"Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film ."
"True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade ."
"Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time ."
"I'm totally with you on that . "
"Hey , your Chinese is coming along !"
"You think ?"
"Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine ."
"But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy ."
"Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . "
"I can ’ t wait to retire ."
"And then what ?"
"And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !"
"That sounds boring to me ."
"What do you plan on doing after you retire ?"
"Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach ."
"I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . "
"Charles , do you have any children ?"
"Yes ."
"How many children do you have ?"
"I have two kids . A boy and a girl ."
"What are their names ?"
"Jack and Stephanie ."
"How old are they ?"
"Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 ."
"Are they in school ?"
"Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida ."
"What does Stephanie study ?"
"She studies English ."
"Is she here now ?"
"No , she's at school . "
"I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding ."
"Yes . It's perfect ."
"And all of the flowers are in bloom ."
"I couldn't have asked for more . "
"Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time ."
"I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings ."
"That explains it . "
"Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening !"
"You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... , And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ?"
"No ... He told me I'm pregnant !"
"Congratulations !"
"And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... , And they said you should play classical music ?"
"How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! "
"You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ?"
"Yes , I finished last Friday ."
"You sound relieved ."
"Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams ."
"Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ?"
"Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results ."
"You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ?"
"Oh , yes . "
"I noticed your absence in class this morning ."
"I'm sorry , I overslept . "
"How often do you have English lessons ?"
"I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day ."
"How do you practice ?"
"I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week ."
"Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ?"
"Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . "
"What happened to that girl you were seeing ?"
"Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week ."
"That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago ."
"It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho ."
"What do you mean ?"
"She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that ."
"She sounds very emotional ."
"She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place ."
"Were you suppose to be there ?"
"I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this ."
"Ok . You're right . She's a psycho ."
"I'm just glad it's over . "
"Adam . I ’ m sorry ."
"Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late ."
"Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another ."
"why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ?"
"Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters ."
"Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ?"
"Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry ."
"Well . You ’ re here . "
"How was the movie last night ?"
"I didn't really like it ."
"Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography ."
"I found it very disappointing ."
"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see ."
"I wasn't happy with it ."
"Nothing is to your satisfaction . "
"hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ?"
"everything's great . I've just returned from my office ."
"your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ?"
"sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area ."
"a virtual office ?"
"yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building ."
"what kind of services do they offer ?"
"a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office ."
"sounds fun.what else ?"
"I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor ."
"oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image ."
"you bet it ! "
"That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up ."
"It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here ."
"I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?"
"I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth ."
"I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag ."
"Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks ."
"Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too ."
"Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious ."
"I think that she had a litter too much of the punch ."
"What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong ."
"That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ?"
"Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves ."
"That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ?"
"All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? "
"Mom , this is your third bowl of rice !"
"I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more ."
"Why ? I never saw you eat so much before ."
"I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time ."
"So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out ."
"Don't pull my leg ."
"This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ?"
"Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now ."
"Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ?"
"I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed ."
"Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise ."
"Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself ."
"He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy ."
"Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato ."
"Who knows ! "
"Susan has got the cancer of stomach ."
"How terrible ! This is quite unexpected !"
"Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her ."
"What happened ?"
"Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . "
"Thanks a million ."
"Don't mention it . "
"Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?"
"That depends . What does she look like ?"
"Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair ."
"How tall is she ?"
"She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me ."
"Is she chubby ?"
"Not at all . She's actually very athletic ."
"It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ?"
"No , but she does wear contact lenses ."
"How's her skin ?"
"She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose ."
"Does she have any piercings or tattoos ?"
"I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot ."
"What's the tattoo on her foot like ?"
"It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one ."
"Even her mother ?"
"Yes , even her mother ."
"What's her personality like ?"
"She's a lot like me ."
"So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! "
"I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat ."
"That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ?"
"Perfect !"
"Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time ."
"Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... , What is it ?"
"I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . "
"How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ?"
"Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up ."
"What do you have for breakfast ?"
"I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast ."
"that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?"
"I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there ."
"How do you spend your afternoons ?"
"I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . "
"Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ?"
"Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary ."
"What ? That's too much ."
"Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation ."
"Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget ."
"Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good ."
"Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel ."
"In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . "
"Julia , what do you think of the network ?"
"Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails ."
"Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword ."
"What do you mean ?"
"I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc ."
"I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm ."
"Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . "
"I'm tired ."
"Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours ."
"Yeah , I need to take a break . "
"Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ?"
"My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan ."
"Where do you come from ?"
"I come from China.Are you American ?"
"Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ?"
"Business management , That sounds interesting . "
"Hi , Alex . How are you doing ?"
"Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work !"
"I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner ."
"I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? "
"I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City ."
"Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ?"
"Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here ."
"I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York ."
"Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live ."
"Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . "
"How about a movie tonight ?"
"It doesn ’ t matter to me ."
"Does 7 o'clock suit you ?"
"Either way . I don ’ t care ."
"How about a snack after work ?"
"I couldn ’ t careless ."
"Would you rather stay home ?"
"Whatever you say ."
"Are you really interested in doing something ?"
"I don ’ t mind if you want to . "
"Have you ever played Making ?"
"Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game ."
"Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master ."
"Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself ."
"It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . "
"Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting ."
"Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career ."
"Do you mean financially rewarding ?"
"Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries ."
"I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy ."
"Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive ."
"How much do you make ?"
"I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . "
"Do you have any idea for this vacation ?"
"Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ?"
"Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs ."
"OK . "
"Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ?"
"Yes , he is . "
"Mary , how was your date with John ?"
"It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common ."
"Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?"
"He is tall and slim , fair-haired ."
"Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?"
"He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous ."
"Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . "
"I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian ."
"Thank you ."
"Where is she going to college ?"
"She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship ."
"Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !"
"Thank you . "
"Hey Jackie . What are you doing ?"
"Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ?"
"I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ?"
"Are they having a sale ?"
"Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on ."
"That sounds great . Where should we meet ?"
"I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes ."
"Sounds good . See you there ."
"What do you think about these shoes ?"
"They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ?"
"No . Not really ."
"This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design ."
"I bet it's expensive ."
"It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ?"
"For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . "
"Our philosophy teacher is very humorous ."
"I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious ."
"No , not at all.The examples he gives are very interesting ."
"No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . "
"Bonjour !"
"What ?"
"I said , Bonjour !"
"What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ?"
"I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ?"
"What ’ s wrong with speaking English ?"
"Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed !"
"What are you doing that for ?"
"I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job ."
"Good for you . "
"What have you been up to , Johnny ?"
"You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... , Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ?"
"You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes ."
"You have all the fun , don't you ?"
"Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone ."
"Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! "
"I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah ."
"You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you ."
"Nice meeting you , too . "
"I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ?"
"He has been keeping bach after divorce ."
"He would have recovered from the stress and got married again ."
"Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . "
"Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ?"
"Is that different from this kind of zoo ?"
"Yes , of course ."
"So tell me about it !"
"There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting ."
"Special rules ?"
"There , you only have two ways for visiting ."
"Details ?"
"On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region ."
"Why not ?"
"Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be ."
"That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ?"
"Yes ."
"I prefer to go there next time ."
"Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . "
"Has the chief accepted our plan ?"
"Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help ."
"Let ’ s have a try . "
"What are you doing there with your mobile phone ?"
"I'm moblogging !"
"Moblogging ? what does that mean ?"
"Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices ."
"Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient ."
"Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me ."
"How can you do that ?"
"Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser ."
"What if you want to publish some photos ?"
"Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog ."
"I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you ."
"You bet it ! "
"I don't think much of the film ."
"But I think it wasn't too bad ."
"Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense !"
"It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . "
"So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ?"
"Well , I like to play the piano ."
"Really ? How long have you been playing piano ?"
"About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid ."
"That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time ."
"Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?"
"Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . "
"Well , how was your honeymoon ?"
"It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing ."
"Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !"
"Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?"
"My friends and I just got back from Bali ."
"Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?"
"Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free ."
"Did you go diving while you were there ?"
"I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead !"
"Did you take any pictures in the ocean ?"
"I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you ."
"Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?"
"We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ?"
"No , but I do like snowboarding ."
"Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?"
"I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !"
"It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . "
"I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ?"
"Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured ."
"I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary ."
"That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job ."
"I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die ."
"I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension ."
"That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire ."
"Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ?"
"Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk . "
"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it ."
"How many credits for each course ?"
"Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department ."
"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . "
"You mean it shuts off to save energy ?"
"Yep . And it breathes , see !"
"It's not breathing !"
"Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on ."
"Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly ."
"I would look so cool carrying this around ! "
"The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned ."
"Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ?"
"I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion ."
"I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ?"
"I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ?"
"I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime ."
"That would be nice . Can you read the characters ?"
"I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character ."
"I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . "
"Paul failed again ."
"He'll never do well in mathematics ."
"How can we help him ?"
"Well , I can't help . "
"Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ?"
"Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby !"
"Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man !"
"I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place ."
"Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything ."
"Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ?"
"Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! "
"Are you free tomorrow , Sam ?"
"Yeah , what's up ?"
"I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? "
"You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I have been here for three years ."
"Do you like this campus ?"
"Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it ."
"How come ?"
"It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected ."
"Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped ."
"I ’ ll just have to put up with it . "
"Why don't you go out with Jack ?"
"He makes me sick . "
"Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad ."
"I just lost my job . My boss just told me ."
"That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?"
"I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money ."
"I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . "
"I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution ."
"Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country ."
"That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry ."
"Yeah , you are right ."
"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced ."
"The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it ."
"I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed . "
"Whose handset sounds so beautiful , Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ?"
"Are you able to compose music ?"
"No , not yet ."
"Who composed it for your ?"
"You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one ."
"Can I get on line to search one , too ?"
"Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON ."
"What about my SIEMENS ?"
"Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . "
"Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend ."
"A house warming party ?"
"Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn ."
"Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy ."
"Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive ."
"I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city ."
"That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby ."
"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . "
"Tell me something about your Valentine's Day ."
"Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return ."
"So romantic.young people must have lot of fun ."
"Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ? "
"Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ?"
"Coming as ?"
"Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume !"
"Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there ."
"Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ?"
"Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit ."
"Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ?"
"Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry ."
"Feed them ?"
"Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts ."
"And then later everyone eats the food ?"
"Yes ! How did you guess that ?"
"It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ?"
"Good Point !"
"But no dressing up like ghosts , right ?"
"No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? "
"Hey Annie , who is this picture of ?"
"Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather ."
"I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ?"
"Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself ."
"Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ?"
"He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom ."
"He looks like a very personable man ."
"He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . "
"Does Tom drink a lot ?"
"Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table ."
"That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . "
"Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !"
"Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me ."
"What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ?"
"Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies ."
"Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that ."
"You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! "
"Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ?"
"Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon ."
"Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ?"
"I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now ."
"It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back ."
"Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . "
"He is planning again ."
"Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money ."
"That is him . "
"Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you ."
"Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . "
"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives ."
"It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points ."
"Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone ."
"For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study ."
"That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones ."
"Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . "
"The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off ."
"That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines ."
"Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal ."
"Do you prefer brandy or ports ."
"Port , please ."
"Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor ."
"The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?"
"Yes . You always have a good nose for wines ."
"Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine ."
"Oh , what's that ?"
"It's made from naturally frozen grapes ."
"Why not ? It sounds great ."
"OK , here's to your health ."
"Thanks . Cheers ."
"Cheers . "
"You seem to be unhappy . What happened ?"
"My mother is ill in the hospital ."
"What does the doctor say ?"
"The disease fails to respond to drugs . "
"Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?"
"Bourbon , please ."
"How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ?"
"With iced water , please ."
"Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water ."
"Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ?"
"The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars ."
"That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change ."
"Thanks a lot . "
"Jack's been looking unhappy lately ."
"His girlfriend broke up with him ."
"No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . "
"Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up ."
"How high did the price go ?"
"I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 ."
"You didn't watch the end of the auction ?"
"No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . "
"more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners ."
"that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners ."
"oh , why ?"
"I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them ."
"I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples ."
"well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ?"
"I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men ."
"or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men ."
"what do you mean ?"
"you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl ."
"a left girl ? What's that ?"
"they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , , you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love ."
"that ' for sure but very few . "
"I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world ."
"How about the languages ."
"I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one ."
"That's more convenient . "
"How about having a cup of tea with us ?"
"All right.That ’ s very nice of you ."
"Would you like to go to the cinema with me ?"
"I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . "
"Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ?"
"Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again !"
"How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight ."
"Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... , Look , it's starting !"
"Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? "
"Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ?"
"I'd like that very much ."
"How does 7:30 sound ?"
"Fine . See you later . "
"David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great !"
"You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema ."
"How was it ?"
"Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable ."
"It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ?"
"Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . "
"Wow ! That's a fantastic movie !"
"Yes . I love it , too ."
"Who was the director ?"
"I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . "
"the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ?"
"I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures ."
"where are you planning on going ?"
"I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ?"
"I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there ."
"would you recommend going there for a few days ?"
"personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital ."
"you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ?"
"it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ?"
"I ’ d like to get away from the big city life ."
"maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing ."
"I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away ."
"since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number ."
"thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . "
"What are you worrying about ?"
"I am worrying about my husband ."
"Where is he ? Is he in danger ?"
"You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . "
"Guess who I saw yesterday ?"
"Who ?"
"My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ?"
"Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ?"
"Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady ."
"Oh , she is ."
"You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others ."
"Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim ."
"Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . "
"What type of movies do you like ?"
"I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction ."
"That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ?"
"Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for ."
"Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining ."
"Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious ."
"Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . "
"Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English ."
"You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you ."
"I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect ."
"Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though ."
"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . "
"Hey , your Chinese is coming along !"
"You think ?"
"Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine ."
"But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy ."
"Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . "
"Alison , would you like to have some more ?"
"No thanks . I've had enough ."
"Actually you haven't had much ."
"To tell you the truth , I am on the diet ."
"That sounds ridiculous . Why ?"
"Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
"Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?"
"Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight ."
"What are they ?"
"One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families ."
"Why ?"
"The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis ."
"That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper ."
"And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat ."
"What's that ?"
"Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !"
"Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising ."
"Yeah , I guess so ."
"You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise ."
"Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds ."
"So what happened ?"
"Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds ."
"You should have kept trying . "
"Jack and Mary broke up ."
"it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?"
"Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately ."
"really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?"
"no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time ."
"maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people ."
"how so ?"
"he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them ."
"poor Mary ! She really liked him ."
"anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better ."
"do you think they ’ ll get back together ?"
"no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind ."
"I hope she ’ ll recover soon ."
"so do I . "
"Did you hear about Bob and Mary ?"
"No , what happened ?"
"They had an argument and split up ."
"Really , what's going to happen now ? "
"Nick ! How ’ s it going ?"
"Oh , hey ... , What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ?"
"Actually , my office is right around the corner ."
"It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment ."
"Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion ."
"Sure , you still have my contact details , right ?"
"You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?"
"Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . "
"Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland ."
"Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals ."
"That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards !"
"Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie !"
"Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores , What an amazing goal ! "
"What channel did you watch last night ?"
"Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions ."
"You did ? How do you like the fashion show ?"
"It was very good . I followed it right to the end . "
"What are you doing ?"
"I'm surfing the Net . "
"Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland ."
"It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions ."
"Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball !"
"Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !"
"A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive !"
"The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !"
"Great play !"
"We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone !"
"Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! "
"So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim ."
"You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way ."
"I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on ."
"Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike . "
"Jack and Mary broke up ."
"It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?"
"Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately ."
"Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?"
"No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time ."
"Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people ."
"How so ?"
"He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them ."
"Poor Mary ! She really liked him ."
"Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better ."
"Do you think they ’ ll get back together ?"
"No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind ."
"I hope she ’ ll recover soon ."
"So do I . "
"So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ?"
"Well , I like to play the piano ."
"Really ? How long have you been playing piano ?"
"About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid ."
"That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time ."
"Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?"
"Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . "
"She is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ?"
"Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her ."
"What's it like to work with her ?"
"She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight ."
"Tell me about it ."
"You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves ."
"Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . "
"I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ?"
"A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ?"
"Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ?"
"I don't know . I never went to one ."
"Never ? Really ? I'm surprised ."
"Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do ."
"But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here ."
"OK , let's go . "
"I'll see you in Sterlet , then ."
"Where did you say ?"
"Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y ."
"Right . "
"Listen to this . Mary got married ."
"Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it !"
"Yes . Yesterday ."
"Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !"
"She married Jerrod ."
"You ’ re kidding ."
"She ’ s going to live in Paris ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised . "
"I am trying to decide what school to apply to ?"
"Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?"
"I am not sure . What's the difference between them ?"
"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere ."
"Which is better ?"
"One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers ."
"I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools ."
"Yes , sometimes . "
"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it ."
"How many credits for each course ?"
"Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department ."
"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . "
"I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know ."
"Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones ."
"I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance ."
"It seems you have to take time . "
"Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ?"
"I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room ."
"Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all ."
"What are we doing ?"
"Mr . : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves . Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage ."
"May I have a book ?"
"Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition . "
"John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ?"
"Yes , I watched once ."
"What do you think of it ?"
"Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form ."
"I couldn ’ t agree more . Actually , I ’ m a Beijing Opera fan ."
"Really ? Good for you . "
"Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning ."
"What ’ s up ?"
"I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow ."
"America ? Did you get admit to MIT ?"
"Yes ."
"Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you ."
"Thank you ."
"Really going to miss you ."
"Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call ."
"Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey ."
"Thank you ."
"Look after yourself . Bye ."
"Bye . "
"I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive ."
"Yes . I dare say it will be ."
"It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed ."
"No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open ."
"But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money ."
"Mmm , you may be right ."
"Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ?"
"No . We couldn ’ t possibly ."
"Why not ?"
"It will be summer . So it will be hot ."
"Is that very likely in England ?"
"Yes . It could happen . "
"My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping !"
"Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ?"
"Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection ."
"Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... , You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning !"
"Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ?"
"Near sighted . "
"There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ?"
"What are the movies that are playing ?"
"There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon ."
"I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it ."
"So , is that a yes ?"
"Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ?"
"It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main ."
"Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! "
"Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees ."
"Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ?"
"I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous ."
"So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ?"
"They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . "
"Hi , Peter . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make it to dinner tomorrow night ."
"Oh , why not ?"
"It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself ."
"Thanks . I will . "
"Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ?"
"I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails ."
"Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients ."
"That ’ s good ."
"( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow ."
"Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent . "
"Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan ."
"My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores ."
"What are you assigned to do ?"
"God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking ."
"For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week ."
"I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them ."
"I couldn't agree more . "
"So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet ."
"And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?"
"Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food ."
"I ’ Ve heard this one before ."
"But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !"
"Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see ."
"Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? "
"I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa ."
"Not at all , Sam ."
"I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . "
"It's snowing heavily ."
"It is very common in the winter in Ottawa ."
"The snow is so beautiful . "
"Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ?"
"No . what's it like ?"
"It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing !"
"Would you want to live there ?"
"I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own ."
"What's your dreamhole like then ?"
"My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England ."
"Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?"
"Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important ."
"Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ?"
"No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !"
"I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?"
"No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! "
"Look at what you have done . All thumbs ."
"I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . "
"What is your hobby ?"
"I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals ."
"What kind of reading materials do you like best ?"
"I am interested in science fiction . "
"Do you have to leave soon ?"
"No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty ."
"Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush ."
"Yeah . You know what Dave just said ?"
"What ?"
"He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target ."
"He knows you very well ."
"He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance ."
"I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular ."
"No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . "
"This small town has many serious problems ."
"What's the cause ?"
"The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions ."
"I see why it lags behind other towns . "
"which countries have you been to ?"
"I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada ."
"I thought you had been to Australia too ."
"no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?"
"I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains ."
"isn ’ t it really cold there ?"
"well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter ."
"I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . "
"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon ."
"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?"
"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me ."
"I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day ."
"What about sunday ?"
"I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday ."
"Maybe next week ."
"Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work ."
"Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat ."
"I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . "
"Your muscles are a spectacle !"
"Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ?"
"No , but I am starting working out from now on ."
"Fine . "
"You are an eager beaver ."
"Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . "
"I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis ."
"What's he like ?"
"Oh , he's a very serious person ."
"You must feel very uneasy at his home . "
"I'm more worried about snipers ."
"Snipers ?"
"Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price ."
"So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ?"
"I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction ."
"Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . "
"Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ?"
"I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry ."
"I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ?"
"I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya ."
"Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . "
"Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?"
"Temple fair ?"
"Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now ."
"Sounds interesting !"
"Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common ."
"I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ?"
"What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you ."
"Great ! Do you know how to get there ?"
"Of course ."
"Couldn't be better . "
"How did you first meet Jack each other ?"
"That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark ."
"And then ?"
"I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' , Then he sent you to your home ?"
"Yeah ."
"It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty ."
"He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant ."
"He is so humorous . "
"What are you reading ?"
"Gee ! You scared me !"
"Aha , Fitness Consultant . Very good , Don't you know about the rules in this office ?"
"Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry ."
"Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ?"
"It is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me ."
"What kind of sports ?"
"Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... , Interesting . What were you reading just now ?"
"Stretching exercise after sitting a long time ."
"Really ? That sounds interesting !"
"Can I have my magazine back now ?"
"No . It's confiscated for now . And I will return it to you after I finish reading it . "
"I'm reading an interesting report on Mars ."
"Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ?"
"Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is ."
"Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ?"
"The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation ."
"Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?"
"I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs ."
"One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ?"
"Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago ."
"But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans ."
"I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know ."
"I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there ."
"But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . "
"Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ?"
"Not a bad idea ."
"What would you like to see in Beijing ?"
"Well , let ’ s see . I ’ d like to go to see the Summer Palace ."
"I ’ ll pick you up here tomorrow . "
"When are we leaving for our field trip ?"
"Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . Can you mark that on your calendar ?"
"Yes , I will write that down ."
"That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 ."
"Yes , I will be there on time ."
"We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ?"
"Yes , someone is coming to get me ."
"The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m ."
"What should we bring with us ?"
"I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday ! "
"Mr . : Hello , Mary ."
"Hi ."
"Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school ."
"OK ."
"Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria ."
"It's huge !"
"Mr . : But not big enough . And here is our computer room ."
"There must be about 50 computers in here ."
"Mr . : And over here is our gymnasium ."
"Do I have to take gym ?"
"Mr . : Just like everyone else . "
"In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ?"
"Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks ."
"Is this your best score ?"
"No , once I did 32 . "
"So do you think I can take it ?"
"I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes ."
"I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing ."
"See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down ."
"You ’ re right . "
"Watch out , Patrick !"
"Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . "
"Well , humans could never make something like that ."
"Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit !"
"Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books !"
"OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either !"
"Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! "
"The winter in Ottawa is freezing ."
"From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa ."
"I think I will be adapted to it ."
"Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm ."
"Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . "
"Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ?"
"No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ?"
"Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room ."
"She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious ."
"Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . "
"The bridegroom looks a bit nervous ."
"On this occasion , most people do ."
"Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come ."
"She is a beautiful bride ."
"I am so happy for them ."
"Are you crying ?"
"Yes , I always cry at weddings ."
"Harris and Anne are perfect for each other ."
"Yes , they are ."
"You and Tom also make a great couple ."
"In fact , we are beginning to make preparations ."
"For the wedding ?"
"No , no , for the engagement ."
"Try to catch this bouquet then . "
"Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !"
"Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ?"
"Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you ."
"Sure . Meet me at five . "
"Where will you go in your vacation ?"
"Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation ."
"You're so industrious . "
"I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !"
"Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !"
"Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !"
"Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?"
"That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute !"
"I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception ."
"That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ?"
"Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? "
"It seldom rains this summer ."
"Yeah , some places are very short of water ."
"Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse ."
"You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone ."
"It is serious . "
"These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ?"
"Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child ."
"That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway ."
"Teresa Jones got a boob job ."
"Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight ."
"I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... "
"How are your Chinese lessons going ?"
"Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English ."
"Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier ."
"Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese ."
"Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier ."
"Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . "
"Can we talk ?"
"Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ?"
"You know what I mean ."
"Yeah . I know ."
"I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... , You know , I think you ’ re awesome ."
"I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it ."
"Honey ... , Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... , Baby , I love you so much ."
"You do ?"
"I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome ."
"Oh , I love you too !"
"Come on . Put the gun down ."
"Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . "
"How do you do ? I ’ m Parker ."
"How do you do ? Mr . Barker ."
"Parker ."
"Oh , Parker with a P ?"
"Yes , with a P ."
"Er ... I ’ m Barker ."
"Barker ? With a B . Of course ."
"Yes , with a B ."
"Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ?"
"Thank you , Mr . Parker . "
"Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus ."
"Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient ."
"Okay . It will be a new experience for me ."
"We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy ."
"where do we pay the fare ?"
"Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in ."
"Let me pay for it ."
"Where can I get the subway Madam ?"
"Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations ."
"Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ?"
"No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . "
"I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it ."
"Is it horror movie ?"
"Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ?"
"No way . I will be scared out of my wits ."
"Well , What kind of movies do you like ?"
"Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on ."
"In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies ."
"Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned ."
"Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much ."
"The Terminal is a movie of this type ."
"So we can relax now ."
"Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . "
"Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ?"
"Uh , yes ."
"Do you go to work by train every day ?"
"Yes . I commute five days a week by train ."
"And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ?"
"It ’ s really very good ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"Well , trains are frequent and come on time ."
"Which train do you catch in the evening ?"
"I usually take the 5 thirty home ."
"And can you get a seat ?"
"No , I usually have to stand ."
"Would you agree that the service is fast ?"
"Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . "
"Hi , Kate ."
"Hi , Don . What a surprise !"
"Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now ."
"Have you noticed what has changed ?"
"Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ?"
"Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds ."
"Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break ."
"What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday ."
"Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that ."
"Sure . Join my class next week . "
"How do you usually sell your products now ?"
"I'm doing business through Internet now ."
"Oh , really ? Is it a good way ?"
"Yes , very good ."
"What advantages does it have ?"
"It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time ."
"Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time ."
"Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap ."
"Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ?"
"To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways ."
"You mean there may be credit problems ?"
"Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided ."
"Will you give some suggestion ?"
"Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website ."
"Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . "
"Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?"
"Cinct de mayo ?"
"No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day ."
"Do we get a day off from school then ?"
"No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is ."
"Www , man !"
"In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect ."
"Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?"
"Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality ."
"And then what happened ?"
"Well , as we say , the rest is history ... "
"Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !"
"Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !"
"Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ?"
"He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... , He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?"
"You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !"
"Hold on a sec , his name is David ?"
"Yeah ?"
"That ’ s my brother ! "
"Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ?"
"I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ?"
"Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good ."
"What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new !"
"Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died ."
"Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?"
"I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks ."
"What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! "
"A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine ."
"That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him ."
"He must be regretting about having done the business ."
"I bet he is . He domed his own life . "
"Do you like climbing ?"
"Yes , I like it very much ."
"How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ?"
"Where is it ?"
"It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' ."
"Have you visited it before ?"
"Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting ."
"Like what ?"
"It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between ."
"Sounds marvelous ."
"You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain ."
"Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . "
"What had make you so upset ?"
"Frank has gone out with Lucy again ."
"What ’ s wrong with that ?"
"Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . "
"To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring ."
"To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had ."
"How could you manage to pass the exam ?"
"It is still a mystery to me . "
"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair ."
"Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living ."
"That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified ."
"I guess I never thought of that before ."
"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government ."
"Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! "
"Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ?"
"Well , I have the day off from work ."
"That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy ."
"Sounds nice ."
"Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies ."
"Can I stop by ?"
"Sure . Any time . "
"Judy , what is everybody talking about ?"
"Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager ."
"You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true ."
"Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised ."
"Me too . "
"Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock ."
"Really ? I didn't realize it was so late ."
"I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . "
"Where are you going this weekend ?"
"I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day ."
"So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?"
"Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ?"
"Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel ."
"Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ?"
"Your tent and enough food and water ."
"You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ?"
"We can go fishing , chatting and camping ."
"What are we waiting for ? Come on !"
"Don't hurry . Wait for my call . "
"so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ?"
"I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ?"
"I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ?"
"camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night !"
"have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ?"
"no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go ."
"it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place ."
"do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ?"
"sure , would you like to see them ?"
"that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?"
"I have a Canon SLR ."
"so , you must be pretty interested in photography then ."
"I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ?"
"actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University ."
"have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ?"
"yes , I was planning on going . Are you ?"
"yes.In fact , maybe we could go together ."
"that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ?"
"how about at 11:00 ?"
"sounds great . see you then . "
"Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school ."
"Wow , that's great ! "
"Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ?"
"The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time ."
"Which city did you like better ?"
"That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries ."
"And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ?"
"Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting ."
"Which one has better nightlife ?"
"Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada ."
"Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . "
"Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English ."
"You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you ."
"I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect ."
"Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though ."
"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . "
"Which language do you speak ?"
"Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa , Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet ."
"How do you find studying a language on the internet ?"
"It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good ."
"I bet you find the character difficult to write !"
"Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me ."
"So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ?"
"Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?"
"In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . "
"What happened to John ?"
"He quit "
"Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ?"
"The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States ."
"Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ?"
"Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools ."
"Which students go to private schools , then ?"
"Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education ."
"But are the public schools good everywhere ?"
"No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city ."
"Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ?"
"The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . "
"We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal ."
"I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same ."
"That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . "
"How have you been ?"
"Fine , thank you ."
"And how ’ s everyone in your family ?"
"Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ?"
"I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . "
"I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me ."
"Oh , that ’ s alright ."
"I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow ."
"No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . "
"How did Jim get the money ?"
"He borrowed it from Nick ."
"He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark ."
"He was too desperate to find some other way . "
"Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding ."
"That must be a long love story ."
"Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young ."
"They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ?"
"I don ’ t know . "
"Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair ."
"What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ?"
"Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years ."
"What a pity . "
"I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ?"
"Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley ."
"I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty ."
"Thank you so much . You're an expert . "
"How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ?"
"Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas ."
"And when did you come to Los Angeles ?"
"In 1978 . I went to college here ."
"Oh . What was your major ?"
"Drama . I was an actor for five years after college ."
"That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ?"
"Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? "
"How are your wedding plans going ?"
"Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already ."
"Are you going to get married in the church ?"
"Neither of us is very religious , so we decided not to get married there ."
"Have you booked the hotel for the reception ?"
"Yes . The Palace Hotel . You have to be there ."
"No problem . "
"Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !"
"Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there ."
"Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !"
"Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! "
"Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection ."
"There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download ."
"I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit ."
"Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net ."
"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?"
"Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone ."
"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things ."
"That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number ."
"That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit ."
"How do I do that ?"
"Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again ."
"That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . "
"Is there any more vodka in that bottle ?"
"Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes ."
"Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way ."
"Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene ."
"So Irene , what do you do ?"
"I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard ."
"Macrohard , eh ?"
"What do you do ?"
"I have my own company that designs computer systems . "
"How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ?"
"You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 ."
"In what ?"
"In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes !"
"Can you do the vault ?"
"I do back flips at the pool all the time . "
"Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ?"
"You said it . We ’ er breathing poisonous air every day ."
"I think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . And people should try to protect environment ."
"I absolutely agree with you . "
"John passed away ."
"When ? I saw him well last month ."
"Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late ."
"How terrible ! "
"Peter is a bag lady now ."
"That black sheep . It serves him right ."
"He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now ."
"It ’ s too late . "
"Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ?"
"I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have ."
"Is rice your staple food , too ?"
"Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . "
"Hi Bob , how ’ s business ?"
"Just okay ."
"Okay , enough small talk . Let ’ s get down to business ."
"Good idea ."
"Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me ."
"No , I can ’ t accept it . Business is business . "
"We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship ."
"What do you mean ?"
"I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him ."
"She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision ."
"I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . "
"Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics !"
"Steve , I was born ready ! I ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today ."
"We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running ."
"Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up ."
"You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . "
"I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday ."
"Don ’ t think any more about it ."
"I must make an apology for losing my temper ."
"It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good ."
"I ’ m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ’ s my fault . "
"Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation ."
"That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now ."
"I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ?"
"I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet ."
"OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out ."
"Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months ."
"3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep ."
"I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it ."
"I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair ."
"Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it ."
"Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs , Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . "
"Did you have any hobbies ?"
"Yes , reading is my hobby ."
"What kind of books do you like to read most ?"
"Many kinds of books . When I was a child in elementary school , I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . When I became to a teenager at middle school , I was interested in detective mystery stories . Now I like reading romance stories ."
"Are you in love ?"
"Why ?"
"People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories ."
"Well , maybe . "
"Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ?"
"The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check ."
"I can lend you some money ."
"Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set ."
"Can I help in anyway ?"
"You can take me to the bank if you want to ."
"Sure . Let ’ s go . "
"Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner ."
"We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival ."
"My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month ."
"What do you think we can see during the festival ?"
"I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations ."
"I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park ."
"Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows ."
"Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . "
"How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales ."
"You're right . We're not really into used stuff ."
"Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them !"
"There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites ."
"I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later ."
"Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! "
"What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ?"
"They aren't evenly matched ."
"Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole ."
"Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . "
"Did you move into your new apartment ?"
"Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet ."
"Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized ."
"Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it ."
"Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?"
"Unfortunately , yes ."
"What do you mean by that ?"
"I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes ."
"Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent ."
"I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure ."
"Is there a supermarket nearby ?"
"Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket ."
"Sounds like you better buy a bicycle ."
"That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . "
"How are you doing with your English Language studies ?"
"I think I'm making good progress ."
"Is it harder than you thought ?"
"At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . "
"I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ?"
"Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . "
"Can you believe the headlines ?"
"What are you reading ?"
"I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King ."
"Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ?"
"He got arrested all right ."
"If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison ."
"Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless ."
"I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire ."
"That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail ."
"I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years ."
"Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves ."
"So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?"
"He's giving lectures on business at colleges . "
"I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today ."
"Yeah , I quit ."
"Why ?"
"I'm fed up with his boring lectures . "
"The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all ."
"Maybe you can't be so sure ."
"Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious ."
"But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth ."
"I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . "
"I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?"
"Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices ."
"The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first ."
"Why not start with the most interesting one ?"
"Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision ."
"Toss a coin to decide then . "
"Good morning , Kevin ."
"Morning , Lee . How are you ?"
"Very well , thank you . "
"I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you ."
"I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help ."
"Then keep up the good work . "
"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?"
"I don ’ t know ."
"Please think it over ."
"Oh , I see ."
"Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it ."
"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend ."
"Ur , you really let me down ."
"Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory ."
"No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband ."
"What day is it on earth ?"
"It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ?"
"Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ?"
"Yes , but I don't think they are enough for me ."
"Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period ."
"That's a good idea . Thanks a lot ."
"You are welcome . "
"Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are ."
"Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity ."
"I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me ."
"You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her ."
"Nothing rang a bell . "
"Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ?"
"It was terrific . I really enjoyed it ."
"Great . How long were you away ?"
"I was there for about three weeks ."
"That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ?"
"Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago ."
"So , what was the best thing about your trip ?"
"Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . "
"I am really impressed with your presentation skills ."
"Thank you . I have been working on it for several years ."
"Well , your time has been well spent !"
"It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff !"
"Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! "
"welcome back ! How was your vacation ?"
"it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !"
"where did you end up going ?"
"because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there ."
"I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?"
"that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?"
"sure . What's this one a picture of ?"
"oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city ."
"you don't look very happy in that picture ."
"no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !"
"so what did you do ?"
"we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel ."
"my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?"
"of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though ."
"that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . "
"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?"
"Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field ."
"Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . "
"How delicious ! Tender and crisp !"
"This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir ."
"Yes , it's really savory ."
"Thank you for appreciating it . "
"I am tired of everything in my life ."
"What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you ."
"You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings ."
"Maybe you are right . "
"You know that ? Dan got a divorce ."
"Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much ."
"Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife ."
"He deserved it . "
"Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ?"
"It's an excellent one . I like it very much ."
"Why ?"
"It includes a lot of useful words and phrases ."
"I agree with you . "
"Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already ."
"Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money ."
"Gambling ? Where ?"
"Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know ."
"If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . "
"What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?"
"We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River ."
"How hard is the climb ?"
"It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet ."
"What did you do last week ?"
"We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting ."
"Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it ."
"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb ."
"Yeah , I will . See you then !"
"O . K . See you . "
"Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ?"
"I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety ."
"What about the environmental factors ?"
"Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive ."
"Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . "
"I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food ."
"I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired ."
"Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself ."
"Have you found anything yet ?"
"You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?"
"You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school ."
"I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem ."
"But the parking might be ."
"You bet ! "
"Thanks for everything ."
"Don't mention it . "
"You look pale , you must have poor health ."
"Yeah . You said it ."
"Why not go to see the doctor ?"
"I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . "
"I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing ."
"Believe what ?"
"You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... , You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort ."
"What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ?"
"To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth ."
"Do you believe that one religion is better than another ?"
"No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better ."
"Do you go to church regularly ?"
"When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . "
"I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening ."
"What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ?"
"Helen is nice but she talks a lot ."
"Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film ."
"It sure is . "
"Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland ."
"Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals ."
"That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards !"
"Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie !"
"Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores ."
"What an amazing goal ! "
"Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ?"
"Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom ."
"Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid ."
"Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles ."
"I see.Thank you . "
"Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll ."
"I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one ."
"Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things ."
"Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . "
"I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !"
"Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !"
"Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ?"
"He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... , He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?"
"You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !"
"Hold on a sec , his name is David ?"
"Yeah ?"
"That ’ s my brother ! "
"Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ?"
"I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours ."
"That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good ."
"Sure , they do ."
"But why do you choose cycling at first ?"
"Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection ."
"You are really a good citizen ."
"That ’ s what I can do . "
"Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ?"
"Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ?"
"Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do !"
"Did you bow back ?"
"No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended ."
"Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake ."
"But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ?"
"Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude ."
"Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ?"
"I think it's highly possible , yes ."
"The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country ."
"That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone ."
"That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . "
"It's raining ."
"Oh , no ! Not again . "
"How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ?"
"I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer !"
"Tell me about it ."
"Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see ."
"Really ?"
"That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m ."
"Are you serious ?"
"I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! "
"What courses did you major in ?"
"I took more than 10 subjects including Theoretical Economics , Political Economics , Western Economics , Statistics and so on . In addition to the courses of my major , I took minor courses too ."
"What courses did you minor in ?"
"I took computer science and English courses as my minor subjects . "
"Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful ."
"If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too ."
"What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken !"
"Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids ."
"Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are ."
"OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . "
"Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ?"
"I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest ."
"Oh right ... How about Sunday ?"
"Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football ."
"Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok ."
"Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock ."
"Oh great , I ’ ll see you there ! "
"Who's singing in your home , Jim ?"
"It's Ellie and her friends ."
"Who's Ellie ?"
"She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing "" Happy Birthday "" ."
"Oh , I see.how old is she ?"
"She's ten ."
"I suppose they're playing games ."
"Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ?"
"Today ."
"Today ?"
"Yes ."
"Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?"
"Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?"
"Very much.What time ?"
"About 6 ."
"I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday . "
"I'm feeling wonderful ."
"Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception , I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool ."
"I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . "
"Do you surf online regularly , Joe ?"
"Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day ."
"Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ?"
"Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends ."
"Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ?"
"No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me ."
"It sounds interesting . "
"Are there many idioms in English ?"
"There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions ."
"Can you give us an example ?"
"I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information ."
"What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?"
"That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages ."
"This is interesting , Ms.Parker . "
"Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?"
"No.Why ?"
"Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so ."
"Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day . "
"He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business ."
"He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us ."
"When we were students , he was no good in any subject ."
"It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . "
"Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with ."
"But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM ."
"Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in !"
"What other features are listed ?"
"It says that it comes in teal and tangerine ."
"Totally cool colors !"
"And it says that it sleeps . "
"Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature ."
"You do ?"
"Yeah , those classics from the great writers ."
"But I find Japanese ones better . "
"How is grandpa doing recently ?"
"Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back !"
"Maybe I would talk with him someday ."
"I hope it will be of some use . "
"Hello , Mrs . Taylor . I'm here to pick up Diane ."
"Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . "
"Hi , Lucy !"
"Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ?"
"Yes , It's very great ."
"Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ?"
"You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money ."
"Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?"
"Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet ."
"Oh , I'll try to catch it . "
"I ’ ll be away for a moment ."
"Yes ? Anything I can do for you ?"
"Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ?"
"Ok . "
"Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise ."
"How about taking a walk in the park ?"
"OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh ."
"Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !"
"Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left ."
"Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu ."
"A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . "
"How did you two meet ?"
"To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental . "
"Have we met ?"
"I don't think so . Michael ."
"Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you ."
"Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ?"
"I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ?"
"I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ... "
"What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?"
"Probably nothing ."
"You have to do something romantic ."
"Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means ."
"Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !"
"Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . "
"Any chance of using your telephone ?"
"You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying ."
"Well , I thought it was not that serious . "
"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?"
"Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it ."
"But he seems to be very happy with Rose ."
"He is more nice than wise . "
"I am tired of everything in my life ."
"What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you ."
"You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings ."
"Maybe you are right . "
"So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done !"
"Thanks . Now , I have to find a job ."
"What are you thinking of doing ?"
"I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough ."
"There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit , Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made ."
"Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . "
"What newspaper are you reading ?"
"New York Times . I read it everyday ."
"Why don't you read the local newspaper ?"
"It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting ."
"New York Times is better ?"
"Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . "
"Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem ."
"I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth ."
"Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her ."
"I see . OK . "
"Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning ."
"I ’ Ve been playing computer games ."
"What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ?"
"It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world ."
"You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !"
"My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me ."
"Fine !"
"Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat ."
"Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! "
"Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing !"
"Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo ."
"You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good !"
"Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise ."
"He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . "
"Does your wife work ?"
"Yes , she does . She works at home ."
"Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?"
"Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer ."
"You are really a hen-pecked husband . "
"What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ?"
"I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?"
"I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv ."
"I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence ."
"Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !"
"Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs ."
"In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour ."
"That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?"
"No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ?"
"Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month ."
"Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs ."
"Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? "
"Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?"
"Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?"
"I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?"
"Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me ."
"My pleasure ."
"I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?"
"A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece ."
"You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price ."
"Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day ."
"Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?"
"Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you ."
"8 pm , that's fine with me ."
"Okay ."
"So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 ."
"Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night ."
"Ok , George . Bye !"
"Bye , Ann ! "
"Don't just stand outside . Come on in ."
"Yeah ."
"This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean ."
"Nice to meet you guys ."
"Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team ."
"Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ?"
"That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ?"
"He sure is !"
"Come on . I'll introduce you two . "
"Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ?"
"I don ’ t think so ."
"How about going to a concert ?"
"That ’ s should be fun . "
"I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market ."
"Easy come , easy go . "
"we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ?"
"I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ?"
"oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's ."
"Jack ?"
"yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ?"
"I will never go out with him anymore ."
"why did you say so ?"
"last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all !"
"oh , really ?"
"he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly ."
"are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?"
"it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him ."
"what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ?"
"I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much ."
"maybe he should really something about eating etiquette ."
"oh , he really should . "
"So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet ."
"And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?"
"Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food ."
"I ’ Ve heard this one before ."
"But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !"
"Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see ."
"Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? "
"The government has to face a lot of social problems now ."
"I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems ."
"But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently ."
"You are right . "
"What's your favorite sport ?"
"It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week ."
"Is the entrance charge expensive ?"
"Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute ."
"Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ?"
"You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two ."
"You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . "
"Oh , no . It looks like we're late ."
"Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here ."
"There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ?"
"They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen ."
"That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well ."
"Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! "
"... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end ."
"With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment ."
"Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger !"
"This one ?"
"That ’ s my index finger !"
"Oh , right . This one , right ?"
"Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick ."
"Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger !"
"That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! "
"I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them ."
"What was wrong ?"
"You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone ."
"I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone ."
"I know , I know . But someone took offence . "
"hello . Where are you headed today ?"
"I'm off to Barcelona for a week ."
"do you have your passport with you ?"
"yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?"
"fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport ."
"that's good advice ."
"would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?"
"are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?"
"let me see here ... yes , there's one left ."
"ok . I'll take that one then ."
"alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?"
"I like to travel light so I just have this one ."
"if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?"
"yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?"
"you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! "
"Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone ."
"Don ’ t worry about it ."
"I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it ."
"I think you just need to get more sleep ."
"Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . "
"We can't wait any longer ... , I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... , You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ?"
"I can't afford to ."
"All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ?"
"Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials ."
"Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well ."
"Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . "
"Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ?"
"Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately ."
"How many hours do you work each day now ?"
"12 hours , including 5 hours overtime ."
"That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ?"
"I don't care . I need money ."
"Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ?"
"Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half ."
"Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise ."
"But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage ."
"That's true . "
"Trina , will you marry me ?"
"Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you !"
"Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you ."
"Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning !"
"She what ?"
"Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending ."
"Four hundred ?"
"No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?"
"Ah ... , And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !"
"Wow ."
"See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of ."
"If I survive the next six months . "
"No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ?"
"Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field ."
"He won the first place !"
"Good boy ! "
"What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ?"
"Coffee , please ."
"So , you also like Coffee ?"
"Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning ."
"Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy ."
"I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver ."
"But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction , I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory ."
"Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine !"
"Maybe you are right to some extent ."
"You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel ."
"Maybe I could have a try . "
"May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ?"
"OK . What time ?"
"2:30 , please ."
"It's 60 yuan , please ."
"Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ?"
"Sure . That'll be 40 yuan , please ."
"Here is 50 yuan . "
"Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer ."
"I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek ."
"I know what you mean . I can't stand computer geeks ."
"Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do ."
"Who do you think it is ? "
"I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times ."
"You mean Lily's boyfriend ?"
"Yeah ."
"Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . "
"Mike , what are you doing tonight ?"
"Nothing special . I just want to get plastered ."
"I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's ."
"YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span ."
"Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's ."
"On second thought , I think I'll join you ."
"They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised ."
"Wow , they really went to town on this place !"
"Quite a difference , huh ?"
"Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please ."
"Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking ."
"When in Rome , do as the Romans do . "
"The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break !"
"I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy !"
"That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ?"
"Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . "
"So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ?"
"No , I first came here 1995 ."
"Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ?"
"Well , I am from Canada . Actually ."
"Oh , I am so sorry ."
"That ' ok . That's happens all the time . "
"Susan is going to get a divorce ."
"How do you know that ?"
"She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage ."
"Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . "
"Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?"
"Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code ."
"Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt ."
"Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . "
"Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ?"
"Speaking ."
"Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party ."
"Of course . How're you ?"
"Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club ."
"I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday ."
"Oh ... that's too bad ."
"Yeah . I really like Lesley ."
"Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well ."
"Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ?"
"At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ?"
"That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show ."
"Sure !"
"See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . "
"OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ?"
"Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ?"
"Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures ."
"OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ?"
"I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s ."
"Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . "
"So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ?"
"Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him ."
"You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ?"
"Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . "
"I think Andy's party will be fun ."
"Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something ."
"What's that ?"
"Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?"
"Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?"
"My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . "
"That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ?"
"Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal ."
"OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs ."
"Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy . "
"Do you believe in god ?"
"Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ?"
"I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?"
"I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one ."
"I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet ."
"I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong ."
"For example ?"
"Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics ."
"Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . "
"Are you Elvin ?"
"Elvin Dixon . Who are you ?"
"I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed ."
"Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual ."
"It is ?"
"You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet ."
"I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . "
"I wish you would not be so selfish ."
"Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch ."
"But you should at least consider your son's future ."
"His mother , not me , should do this . "
"Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious ."
"Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . "
"Is this the A housing office ?"
"Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ?"
"I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full ."
"It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like ."
"Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ?"
"Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As ."
"Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ?"
"The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . "
"Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ?"
"I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick ."
"Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it ."
"I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family ."
"Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it ."
"I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out ."
"OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !"
"You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ?"
"Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... , Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! "
"Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester ."
"Yes , of course . I need your student ID please ."
"Here you are ."
"Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?"
"Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology ."
"Sure . That ’ s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester ?"
"Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though ."
"Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?"
"Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy ."
"Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . "
"I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action ."
"She means business , for sure ."
"Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception ."
"We'd better get back to work ."
"Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... "
"It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic ."
"Well , that's life . "
"You are late . What ’ s the deal ?"
"Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic . "
"Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ?"
"Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ?"
"Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ?"
"A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses ."
"How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ?"
"Normally it can be completed in four years . "
"Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends ."
"I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday ."
"They spend hours there , especially on weekends ."
"Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?"
"I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?"
"Isn ’ t that complicated ?"
"No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund ."
"We ? Do you want to go with me ?"
"Sure . I love going to the mall ."
"What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? "
"Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me !"
"Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ?"
"I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet !"
"What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !"
"I know . I know !"
"Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !"
"You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !"
"Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . "
"Yesterday was April the first ."
"Was it quite special ?"
"Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later ."
"Did you hurry back to the bedroom ?"
"Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting "" April Fool , April Fool "" ."
"Oh , your classmates took you in ."
"Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . "
"Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ?"
"No , I was out . Was it worth watching ?"
"You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero ."
"Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ?"
"Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . "
"How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ?"
"Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change ."
"Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ?"
"Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here ."
"Why would you say that ?"
"They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for ."
"I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable ."
"Have you ever been to Japan ?"
"Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . "
"Morning ."
"Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ?"
"Fine , thank you ."
"It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed !"
"Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright ."
"Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street ."
"No , I didn ’ t hear about that ."
"Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute !"
"No , I don ’ t like football ."
"Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful !"
"She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye ."
"Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th !"
"That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! "
"Hi , how are you doing ?"
"Everything's great . And you ?"
"Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ?"
"No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called "" Chinese-Style Divorce "" ."
"Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking ."
"Yeah . I found it is so close to our life ."
"It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world ."
"You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year ."
"Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too ."
"I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married ."
"Oh , that's too short-lived ."
"That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation ."
"II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage ."
"Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously ."
"In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone ."
"I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . "
"What ’ s your city like ?"
"It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls ."
"Is the traffic bad in the city centre ?"
"Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good ."
"What about restaurants and entertainment ?"
"There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey ."
"Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?"
"There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas ."
"It sounds like a really exciting city to live in ."
"It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . "
"When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ?"
"On the fourth Thursday of November ."
"What do you eat on that day ?"
"People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner ."
"Anything else ?"
"Besides the turkeys , we'll also have other delicious food . Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables ."
"I'm almost hungry . "
"Great party , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yeah , really ."
"By the way , my name is Liu Wei ."
"Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall.You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you ."
"What do you do , Susan ?"
"Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ?"
"I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section ."
"I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . "
"I think that ’ s settled ."
"I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !"
"How dare you speak to me like this ."
"Why not ? "
"Honey , I ’ ll be right back !"
"Where are you going ?"
"I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done ."
"Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?"
"Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !"
"Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !"
"They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !"
"Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . "
"Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card ."
"Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute ."
"Do you know about the Bucky Card ?"
"I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it ."
"The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies ."
"What about beer ?"
"The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee ."
"That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ?"
"Usually it's two dollars off the cover price ."
"And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ?"
"This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money !"
"Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ?"
"It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card ."
"Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper ."
"But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year ."
"Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . "
"He is penny wise and pound-foolish ."
"Why do you say so ?"
"The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues ."
"Maybe all of us are the same . "
"Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ?"
"I didn't sleep much last night ."
"How come ?"
"You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up ."
"Don't you like games , I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends ."
"Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them ."
"Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ?"
"I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information ."
"Yes . "
"I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it ."
"You did ?"
"Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion ."
"What do you think now ?"
"There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all ."
"But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do ."
"That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . "
"I am exhausted . I need some sleep ."
"Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?"
"I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health ."
"Don ’ t worry . It ’ s only a cold . "
"How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ?"
"Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one ."
"You don't like the performance , do you ?"
"Yes , but I don't like the story . "
"I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity ."
"It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?"
"Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept ."
"Wow , I doubt that . "
"So what did you think about the movie ?"
"Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones ."
"Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible !"
"Why do you think so ?"
"Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed ."
"You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures ."
"It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie ."
"Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes ."
"I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling ."
"I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong ."
"Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ?"
"No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak ."
"Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role ."
"I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ?"
"I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one ."
"I hope so , too ."
"Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late ."
"Okay , let's go ! "
"Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you ."
"Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... , Out of hand ."
"Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing ."
"Where ’ d you meet him ?"
"Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... , About what ?"
"Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh ."
"Excuse me ?"
"Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... "
"John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport ."
"Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?"
"He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair ."
"Is there anything else ?"
"He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion ."
"How old is he ?"
"He is in his late thirties ."
"Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?"
"At two thirty . "
"Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ?"
"Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake ."
"What happened ?"
"I really wish I hadn ’ t done it ."
"What on earth are you talking about ?"
"I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed ."
"What were you thinking ?"
"You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well ."
"But what you should do is study hard ."
"I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught ."
"So long as you learn from your mistakes . "
"Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red ."
"Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution ."
"Really ?"
"Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red ."
"I never knew that ."
"Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool ."
"Well , we ’ Ve already done our part ."
"Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up ."
"Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days . The baby ’ s finally growing up a little more ."
"Well , give me a call if you can ’ t make it for some reason . "
"Happy New Year , Jim !"
"Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ?"
"Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family ."
"How nice ! Have fun ! "
"Henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework ."
"It ’ s none of my business ."
"You mean that is my business ."
"I don ’ t say that . But it seems to me the housewife should do that ."
"I ’ m your wife , not a housewife . I have my own work ."
"Hum ... "
"Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon ."
"Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby ."
"Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday ."
"Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own ."
"In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese ."
"Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?"
"It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now ."
"Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? "
"Hello , Lily ."
"Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock ."
"When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left ."
"What would you like today ?"
"I ’ ll have the leg of lamb ."
"And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . "
"How may I help you ?"
"I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for ."
"Have you checked the database ?"
"I checked ."
"Was it on the shelf ?"
"It should have been , but it wasn ’ t ."
"Maybe someone took it ."
"Will you be getting another copy anytime soon ?"
"I ’ m sure we will ."
"Would you be able to reserve it for me ?"
"I sure will ."
"Thank you very much . "
"do you have internet in your room ?"
"sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet ."
"really ? What do you usually do online ?"
"well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting ."
"I never chatted online before . What's it like ."
"well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once ."
"really ? Who do you chat with ?"
"to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were , that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home ."
"well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per , don't worry . "
"You ’ re all set now ?"
"Oh , thank you so much ."
"Really , it was nothing ."
"I really appreciated it ."
"I was happy to help ."
"It was so kind of you ."
"Don ’ t mention it ."
"You ’ re a real friend in need . "
"Let's get together this weekend ."
"Sounds good . "
"Do you like watching TV ?"
"Yes I do , usually ."
"What do you exactly mean by usually ?"
"I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . "
"What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy ."
"His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her ."
"How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys ."
"Love is blind , you know . "
"Can you lend me your car ?"
"Nothing ' doing . "
"You ’ re all set now ?"
"Oh , thank you so much ."
"Really , it was nothing ."
"I really appreciated it ."
"I was happy to help ."
"It was so kind of you ."
"Don ’ t mention it ."
"You ’ re a real friend in need . "
"Hi , Jason !"
"Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ?"
"With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ?"
"It will be held at the Central Music Hall ."
"What is on the program ?"
"It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know ."
"Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together !"
"Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 ."
"See you then . "
"What shall I call him ?"
"Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry ."
"What's he doing ?"
"He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . "
"Hi , John ! How was your vacation ?"
"We went to Malaysia and Thailand ."
"That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?"
"Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia ."
"Wow , isn't that dangerous ?"
"A little , but the rush was worth it ."
"Tell me about it ."
"We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us ."
"500 feet ! I would never be able to do that ."
"Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . "
"Mary , I heard you moved again ."
"Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood ."
"You mean noise ? How could it be ?"
"You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . "
"What do you think of your teacher ?"
"He's very strict with us ."
"And I hear he gives very good lectures ."
"Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . "
"A funny thing happened to me the other day ."
"Oh , yes ?"
"I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again ."
"Mmm ."
"Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him ."
"Really ?"
"Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was ."
"Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens ."
"You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! "
"Hi , how ’ re you doing ?"
"Terrible ."
"Oh , what ’ s the matter ?"
"I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache ."
"Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ?"
"I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help ."
"Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor ."
"Yeah , I guess I should ."
"Well , you ’ d better get some rest ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Bye . "
"Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy ."
"Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true ."
"I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month ."
"The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ?"
"I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . "
"Excuse me . Nature calls ."
"If you gotta go , you gotta go . "
"Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ?"
"No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign ."
"You were born in the year of the monkey ?"
"Yeah , are you surprised ?"
"Not at all ! That explains everything ! "
"How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ?"
"It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies ."
"You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding !"
"I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time ."
"So do we have to stay in this English class forever ?"
"No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation ."
"So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language ."
"You said it . "
"I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ?"
"There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T , I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine ."
"Which tests do you mean ?"
"You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ?"
"Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously ."
"Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy ."
"You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . "
"If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket ."
"But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls !"
"It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ?"
"To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch !"
"OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes . "
"I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !"
"Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels ."
"But it ’ s so old ."
"Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ?"
"No , not at all ."
"First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century ."
"I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ?"
"It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls ."
"Why does he want to do that ?"
"Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for ."
"Won ’ t they get his inheritance ?"
"No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing ."
"I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all ."
"So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?"
"There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that !"
"That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first ."
"It would take a lot less time .. , How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you ."
"Ok . That sounds like a deal . "
"Are there many idioms in English ?"
"There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions ."
"Can you give us an example ?"
"I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information ."
"What about the expression "" goodbye "" ? Is that an idiom ?"
"That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages ."
"This is interesting , Ms.Parker . "
"Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat ."
"Please come in , Mr.Jackson ."
"No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . "
"It is really exciting news ."
"What news ?"
"You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones ."
"You know what we will get ?"
"We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station ."
"What docking station ?"
"This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient ."
"Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . "
"Mary , I have something to tell you ."
"Go ahead ."
"I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you ."
"Come on . Don ’ t hesitate ."
"John made out with other girls at the party yesterday . "
"Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women ."
"That's fate ."
"I feel sorry for her ."
"Maybe this is God's will . "
"I ’ m sorry , Sam . I don ’ t want to foc-concert ."
"How about going to the theatre ?"
"I don ’ t like going to the theatre ."
"Well , what do you like doing ?"
"traveling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ?"
"I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you ."
"I like talking to you too ."
"Do you want to go to an Exhibition ? There ’ s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow ."
"That ’ s a good idea . "
"I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore ."
"Young people enjoy pop songs more ."
"It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all ."
"But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . "
"You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ?"
"Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts ."
"Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures ."
"And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart ."
"Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?"
"Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn ."
"What does he look like ? Can people tell ?"
"Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . "
"Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ?"
"Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ?"
"Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago ."
"Congratulations ! "
"When will the ceremony begin ?"
"The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ?"
"No idea ."
"As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . "
"Hi , Francis ."
"Oh , Mike . How are you doing ?"
"Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart ."
"Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too ."
"Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time ."
"Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you ."
"Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again ."
"Me too . Have a great day . "
"Does your country export a lot of natural resources ?"
"We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China ."
"Which resources do you have to import ?"
"We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries ."
"I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone ."
"Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country ."
"If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent ."
"Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . "
"Have you seen any good movies lately ?"
"It's ages since I went to see a film ."
"Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student ."
"But now I would stay at home watching TV . "
"Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ?"
"Dinner ? Where ?"
"At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang ."
"What kind of food do they serve ?"
"It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious ."
"Oh really ! That sounds lovely . "
"How was the movie last night ?"
"I didn't really like it ."
"Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography ."
"I found it very disappointing ."
"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see ."
"I wasn't happy with it ."
"Nothing is to your satisfaction . "
"Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor ."
"Yes , we're all proud of her !"
"Here's to you , Mary !"
"Cheers ! "
"Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?"
"Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?"
"Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?"
"Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ?"
"Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ?"
"That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?"
"To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best ."
"What do you have in mind ?"
"I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster ."
"Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ?"
"Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?"
"Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ?"
"It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ?"
"Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen ."
"That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?"
"It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time ."
"Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ?"
"Sounds good . I'll see you then ! "
"Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?"
"He has no sense ."
"If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money ."
"But Joe won't you . "
"Is this your new teacher ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"Is she short ?"
"No , she ’ s average ."
"What color are her eyes ?"
"They ’ re dark gray ."
"What color is her hair ?"
"It ’ s blond ."
"And how old is she ?"
"I don ’ t know . "
"I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian ."
"Thank you ."
"Where is she going to college ?"
"She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship ."
"Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !"
"Thank you . "
"I heard you are going out with John ?"
"Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death ."
"You are so lucky ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ?"
"You really think so ?"
"Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too ."
"I sure hope so . "
"I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us ."
"I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... , What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ?"
"Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company ."
"Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ?"
"It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . "
"so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ?"
"Pretty good . How's your business going , Kevin ?"
"Not too bad . "
"London is such a historic city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of , I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader ."
"Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain ."
"Women have often played an important role in british history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british , She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?"
"There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow ."
"I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too ."
"I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go ."
"Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum ."
"There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty ."
"Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! "
"Where is my contract ?"
"It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . "
"There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday ."
"So what ?"
"Look , I have two tickets.Will you go with me ?"
"Wow , I like concerts . "
"Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one ."
"The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog ."
"No wonder . "
"I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy ."
"That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs ."
"Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise ."
"The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... , I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! "
"You are starting to learn English ?"
"Yeah . I like it , Dad ."
"You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand ."
"Really ? "
"I ’ m itching for moving !"
"What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ?"
"It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . "
"I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world !"
"Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma ."
"Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them !"
"Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous !"
"No , fireworks are awesome !"
"Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ?"
"I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all ."
"Ahahah ... really ?"
"Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ?"
"Hey , I offered last year ... , Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... "
"Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today !"
"Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away !"
"Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books ."
"Thanks !"
"Have you forgotten the cheers ?"
"No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly ."
"That's good ! "
"What a brilliant smile !"
"That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling ."
"He must be very easy-going ."
"Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . "
"My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race ."
"Excuse me.What did you say ?"
"A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games , That's incredible . I cann't believe it ."
"You have to . It's sure ."
"How amazing ! "
"It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies ."
"Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you ."
"Which country do you want to go to ?"
"My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?"
"Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America ."
"Which university should I apply to ?"
"There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper ."
"Oh , I see . Thank you very much . "
"How's it going ?"
"Great ! "
"Are you free this Saturday evening ?"
"Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening ."
"Would you like to go to the concert with me ?"
"I'd like to , where ?"
"At our club ."
"When ?"
"At 7:30 p . m ."
"I'll go in time , thank you ."
"I'm so pleased that you can go . "
"You look tired ."
"Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately ."
"Really ? How come ?"
"My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult ."
"You shouldn't work so hard ."
"I know , but hard work pays off . You know ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for . "
"I haven't met the Smiths for a long time ."
"They have moved to Chicago ."
"Why ?"
"Mr.Smith has changed his job . "
"Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I'll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner ."
"Sure , I'm heading out myself . Enjoy your evening ."
"Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads ."
"Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! "
"Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in ."
"Where else haven't we been to yet ?"
"They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ."
"Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ?"
"Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors ."
"Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense !"
"No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... , Enough ! I can't wait anymore . "
"Is the lake very polluted ?"
"Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago ."
"Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ?"
"Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . "
"Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !"
"This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming !"
"That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it !"
"What was that ?"
"Relax , it was just a goat !"
"And that ?"
"It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later ."
"What was that ?"
"Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable ."
"You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! "
"Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective ."
"That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ?"
"Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective ."
"Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not ."
"The internet's a lot worse ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online ."
"Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . "
"Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes , it is . Are you here on business ?"
"No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges ."
"I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time ."
"I couldn ’ t agree more ."
"Great , let ’ s go ! "
"Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ?"
"I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced ."
"There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?"
"I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world ."
"Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?"
"I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger ."
"Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet , Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched ."
"Do you have any successful stories to share ?"
"Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . "
"Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame ."
"Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either ."
"You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... , Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ?"
"I know they're out there . I'll find them ."
"You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? "
"Smith is always careless , it is his Achilles ’ s heel ."
"He would get very angry if anyone criticized him ."
"He will burn his fingers ."
"If only he knew it . "
"Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing ."
"It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult ."
"They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year ."
"Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers ."
"Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus ."
"Ha-ha ! You got me there ! "
"What's the bonus like at your company ?"
"Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary ."
"Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible !"
"Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account ."
"Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt ."
"Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases ."
"What did you buy ?"
"A new home health monitor ."
"Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical ."
"You're kidding !"
"No joke !"
"That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . "
"OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ?"
"I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney ."
"Mm-hm . How long were you there ?"
"I was there for almost a year ."
"Oh , OK ."
"And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly ."
"So , did you , did you lose your finger ?"
"Almost ."
"Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams ."
"Exactly ."
"Will you be going back to Australia soon ?"
"I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . "
"Tom did me many favors ."
"For example ? "
"I have just had my new paper published ."
"You have done excellent work ."
"I'm going to Britain ."
"Really ? How did you get the chance ?"
"I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD ."
"My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University ."
"I really appreciate your kind words . "
"Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate ."
"Thanks , Miss . Wang ."
"You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave ."
"Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . "
"Guess who I saw yesterday ?"
"I don't know . Who ?"
"Avril Lavigen !"
"The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?"
"Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... , So you're a big fan , eh ?"
"Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too ."
"And she was in a movie once again , right ?"
"Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great ."
"What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?"
"She looked sweeter than her pictures ."
"Did you take a photo with her ?"
"No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs ."
"Crazy ! "
"I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades ."
"Grades are based on many things , What counts the most ?"
"Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation ."
"Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ?"
"Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each ."
"What if we miss something ?"
"I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time ."
"Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ?"
"You will be able to track your progress during the year . "
"Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces ."
"How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw ."
"Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool ."
"They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?"
"That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different ."
"Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes ."
"Have you heard Maria Carey ?"
"Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like ."
"Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one ."
"I hope you have a good stereo ."
"Why ?"
"Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . "
"Let's go eat ."
"0kay . Dinner's on me . "
"I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already !"
"Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top ."
"An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me ."
"Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT ."
"GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ?"
"Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts , Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ?"
"Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well !"
"No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat !"
"Umm . . . That's the spirit ! "
"This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ?"
"Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently ."
"For example ?"
"Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to ."
"I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally ."
"You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago !"
"Well , I have no regrets !"
"I ’ ll drink to that ! "
"Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ?"
"Okay ! What do you suggest ?"
"How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater ."
"Is that so ? Why not ?"
"( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead ."
"What's on ?"
"Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night ."
"That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ?"
"Ah . The Royal , I think ."
"What time does it start ?"
"Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think ."
"But we won't have enough time for dinner ."
"Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ?"
"Ah ... I fancy going to the later show ."
"Then , there's a 9:30 show ."
"That's Okay , I think ."
"All right . "
"Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse !"
"Out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
"Who's your favorite singer ?"
"Coco Lee . "
"Are you ready , honey ?"
"Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party ."
"Just dress formal ."
"How about transom ?"
"It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner ."
"Oh , i nearly forget it ."
"You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . "
"Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ?"
"Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up ."
"You are kidding , but she's so helpful ."
"Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you ."
"Come on . She's like that with everyone ."
"I don't think so actually . She never even says "" hello "" to me . "
"What are you doing this weekend ?"
"I don't have any plans . "
"If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up ."
"Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble ."
"No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well ."
"That ’ d be fine . "
"How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?"
"I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me ."
"Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?"
"I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?"
"I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !"
"I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds ."
"I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense ."
"Do you have a brand preference for anything ?"
"I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items ."
"What do you think about the "" impossible is nothing "" billboard on the high street ?"
"It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it ."
"I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention !"
"To each their own ! "
"Our national economy is increasing hand over fist ."
"That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see ."
"I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . "
"Betty was in hospital ."
"I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death ."
"She suffers from cancer ."
"That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . "
"Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?"
"I'd like to very much ."
"All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall ."
"Who's playing ?"
"It's the Powell orchestra ."
"Do you know what they are playing ?"
"They're doing a seventeenth-century program ."
"And who is directing ?"
"Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
"In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy ."
"Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress ."
"Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long ."
"That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool ."
"I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas ."
"In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested ."
"And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity !"
"Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ?"
"Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year ."
"Maybe you are right . "
"Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ?"
"Good idea . Is there a good movie on ?"
"What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time ."
"All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose ."
"My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening ."
"What time does it begin ?"
"At eight thirty ."
"I'll come for you at about eight ."
"OK , I'll be waiting . "
"I ’ d love to have my own farm ."
"It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?"
"I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy ."
"Running a farm would be totally different to you current job ."
"That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office ."
"You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into ."
"My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields ."
"Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . "
"Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce !"
"Are you trying to lose weight ?"
"Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles ."
"You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong ."
"Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?"
"Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors ."
"So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?"
"Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish ."
"If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?"
"Don ’ t count on it . "
"How are you ?"
"Fine ."
"I haven ’ t seen you for several days ."
"Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week ."
"What ’ s he doing ?"
"He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week ."
"He must be happy ."
"Yeah . How are you these days ?"
"Fine too . "
"I ’ d better be going ."
"So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ?"
"I wish I could , but It ’ s already late ."
"Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave ."
"thank you for wonderful meat ."
"I'm glad you enjoy it . "
"Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ?"
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind ."
"That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it ."
"Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . "
"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought ."
"But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills ."
"What do you mean ?"
"They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets ."
"That's not the gadgets.Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . "
"All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull ."
"Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls ."
"Then why are you wearing black shoes ?"
"Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go ."
"Hey , thanks , mum . "
"What's the name of the series just showed ?"
"Doctor Butcher ."
"What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ?"
"No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . "
"What ’ s “ pi ” ?"
"That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think ."
"I see . What is that ratio exactly ?"
"It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ?"
"It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters ."
"Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ?"
"According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound ."
"That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars ."
"What ’ s the next question ."
"Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” ."
"I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together ."
"So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 ."
"Exactly . Anything else ?"
"How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether ."
"You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . "
"How's your new car ?"
"Perfect . Couldn't be better !"
"You made a good choice , then ?"
"It's just what I wanted ."
"No regrets ?"
"I'm really pleased with it . Thanks ."
"I'm glad you're so happy ."
"It's super . "
"Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing ."
"Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ?"
"We don't ."
"No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system ."
"At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary ."
"What about cab drivers and porters ?"
"In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities ."
"You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . "
"Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ?"
"Oh , I took up a new hobby ."
"So you don't travel a lot now ?"
"No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now ."
"It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps ."
"It certainly is . It's so much fun ."
"I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?"
"Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world ."
"Well , every stamp has a story to tell ."
"You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps ."
"Good ."
"Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections ."
"There's a lot to share when you have a common interest ."
"Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors ."
"Ok , good luck . See you , See you , Frank . "
"Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off ."
"What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face ."
"Then what shall I do ?"
"Call the police . "
"Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?"
"Don't brother me !"
"Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help ."
"Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault ."
"So , what's the problem ?"
"I drew a blank on ~ about the test ."
"No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?"
"Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test ."
"That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master ."
"I'm thinking of dropping out ."
"You can't do that , Jenny !"
"I'm dead serious about this , Sally ."
"Come on , let's talk about it . "
"David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?"
"I ’ m not in the mood ."
"Why are you feeling depressed ?"
"I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down ."
"I don ’ t think she will do such a thing ."
"But she did and made me disappointed ."
"Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything ."
"But she means a lot to me ."
"Then forgive her mistake ."
"Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . "
"Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them ."
"Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field ."
"The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ?"
"First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage ."
"Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ?"
"From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives ."
"Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money ."
"It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . "
"Terrible . How about people's lives ?"
"Fortunately , there is no person died ."
"That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake ."
"Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world ."
"That's why many people died in the earthquake ."
"Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other ."
"Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history ."
"Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman ."
"We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake ."
"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else ."
"That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . "
"Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ?"
"You can renew the books over the computer ."
"That's so convenient . "
"I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on ."
"Don ’ t be fool . I ’ ll always side with you ."
"I appreciate your kindness . "
"Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ?"
"There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas ."
"We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ?"
"No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits ."
"There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small ."
"When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams ."
"That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers ."
"You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources ."
"It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests ."
"I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed ."
"Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ?"
"We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . "
"You really should stop smoking , you know ."
"I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though ."
"How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ?"
"About a pack , more if I drink ."
"Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker ."
"No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years ."
"He died of lung cancer , right ?"
"Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . "
"OK , Hello !"
"Hello !"
"Hi , what's your name ?"
"Yeah , my name is Nandu ."
"Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ?"
"Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U ."
"Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ?"
"I'm from Madras . "
"There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ?"
"Is it formal or informal ?"
"I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in ."
"In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better ."
"You are right . What about shoes ?"
"The brown leather shoes are OK ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"Don ’ t mention it . "
"Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking ."
"Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues ."
"But what are the sources of water pollution ?"
"They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources ."
"Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc ."
"aren ’ t they ?"
"Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies ."
"But what about the indirect ones ?"
"Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater ."
"I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it ."
"Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . "
"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office ."
"Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?"
"What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one ."
"Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . "
"David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ?"
"How many members are there in your forum ?"
"a dozen ."
"I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth ."
"It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there ."
"What can we do next after locating the place ?"
"Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . "
"My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.My father is very much completely opposite that.He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice ."
"When is the last time you talked to you parents ?"
"I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well ."
"Are you going to see them soon ?"
"I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in ."
"OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ?"
"I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . "
"Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ?"
"Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs ."
"Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ?"
"I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch ."
"Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! "
"Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?"
"Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns ."
"We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs ."
"Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot ."
"Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers ."
"This is gonna be a great barbecue ! "
"How is Rose now ?"
"It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear about that . "
"Do I have to write the invitation cards ?"
"No , you don ’ t have to . But I think you ought to ."
"Oh , well . If I must , I must . "
"I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting ."
"I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers ."
"The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow ."
"Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation ."
"Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts ."
"Can you ride a horse ?"
"Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?"
"I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?"
"What a good idea ! "
"John hasn't got married up to now ."
"Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ?"
"Really ? Does Mary know that ?"
"Of course not ."
"How silly John is . "
"Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you ."
"Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine ."
"You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?"
"No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent ."
"Do you ever get lonely living alone ?"
"Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! "
"It ’ s really terrible !"
"What are you talking about ?"
"Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all ."
"You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children . "
"Hello , this is Helen speaking ."
"Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ?"
"Fine , thank you . And you ?"
"Fine , thanks . I ’ ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ’ m calling to ask whether you can come or not ."
"Oh , how wonderful . I ’ ll be glad to ."
"Okay , now you are a famous star ."
"Hum , don ’ t say that . Maybe you can do something useful for me ."
"What ’ s wrong with you ?"
"I ’ ll tell you at the party ."
"Okay . "
"Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ?"
"What time dose it start ?"
"In about 25 minutes ."
"Then we'd better get started . "
"Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time , Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ?"
"Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ?"
"Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom ."
"Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? "
"I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here ."
"License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ?"
"I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else ."
"Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ?"
"Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all !"
"Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ?"
"Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole !"
"You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ?"
"You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! "
"What would you reckon the taxing increases ?"
"Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose ."
"But what do most people think about it ?"
"Ah , it ’ s hard to say . "
"Hey , John . Nice car ."
"Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college ."
"What is this , the new Ford ?"
"No , it ’ s last year ’ s model ."
"True . How much did you pay ?"
"$ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car ."
"Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ?"
"Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ?"
"Yeah , sure ."
"Come on . "
"Mr . Brown is in hospital again ."
"Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy ."
"When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale ."
"I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . "
"Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered ."
"I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable ."
"Really ? I hope to meet him soon . "
"Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?"
"Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?"
"Yes , I am applying on it ."
"I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... , Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up ."
"I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field ."
"Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll ."
"Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you . "
"Good evening , John ."
"Good evening , Mary ."
"How are you doing ?"
"I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ?"
"Nothing special ."
"I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ?"
"Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date ."
"I'll call you ."
"All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch ."
"Have a great day , take care , bye . "
"I must apologize for having delayed the work ."
"No , that ’ s not all your fault ."
"But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry , There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it . "
"Are you free this evening , Li ?"
"I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends ."
"What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you ."
"What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ?"
"No , I haven ’ t got any plans ."
"Shall we go out tomorrow then ?"
"Why not ? Sounds good to me . "
"Do you like a package tour or to travel alone ?"
"I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things ."
"I prefer travel alone . I'll have a lot of time lingering at one place . "
"Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ?"
"There ’ s a possibility ."
"What do you mean by that ?"
"I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt ."
"Is that so ?"
"Absolutely . Take my word for it . "
"Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing ."
"Hello , Xu Hua . I'm Paula . I'm American ."
"Welcome to China , Paula ."
"Thank you . "
"Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ?"
"No , not yet . Why ?"
"For suspicion of driving under influence ."
"Oh . I am not his fan . "
"What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ?"
"Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted ."
"In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?"
"That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul ."
"I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?"
"If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch ."
"There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?"
"Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football ."
"The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching ."
"Ok . "
"How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ?"
"Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one ."
"You don't like the performance , do you ?"
"Yes , but I don't like the story . "
"Who's that striking woman over there ?"
"Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her ."
"Really ? Why not ? She looks great ."
"Yes , I know , but she's dangerous ."
"Really ? Tell me more ."
"Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment ."
"Wow , crikey . So what happened ?"
"Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman ."
"Wow ."
"Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ?"
"I have no idea what you're talking about ."
"Oh , come on . Everybody knows ."
"Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call , Oh , sure . "
"Hi ! Peter . How are you ?"
"Fine ! How about you ?"
"Pretty good . "
"Who ’ s that ?"
"It ’ me . Susan Taylor , Oh , please come in . nice to see you ."
"On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee ."
"Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house ."
"Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done ."
"But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp ."
"That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ?"
"It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . "
"Do you like music ?"
"Well , it depends ."
"Do you think the music is well-matched ?"
"No , I think the music is too fast ."
"How about the words of the song ?"
"It sounds nice ."
"I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings ."
"Yes , I think so . It's very emotional ."
"Of course , and I also like the rhythms ."
"Full of energy and hope ."
"Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying ."
"Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . "
"Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit !"
"Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different ."
"Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed ."
"Great ! Is your , too ?"
"Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight ."
"That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing ! "
"You're acting weird tonight ."
"I'm just in the mood to act goofy ."
"What brought this on ?"
"I guess I'm glad exams are over . "
"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?"
"Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything ."
"The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy ."
"Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !"
"I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?"
"You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?"
"Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are ."
"Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down ."
"Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? "
"Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University !"
"Congratulations !"
"How about you ? Have you got any news from university ?"
"No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it ."
"I am glad you can study something you really like ! "
"Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly ."
"No foot gives out scent ."
"But don't forget you are in a cafe ."
"Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed ."
"I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior ."
"Don ’ t pretend you are a good God ."
"You should feel shameful for your behavior ."
"I've never experienced such a kind of feeling ."
"I'm really sick of you . "
"She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing ."
"She wears her heart on her sleeve . "
"Good afternoon , Johnson ."
"Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?"
"Not bad , thanks . "
"I heard that ben is forming his own band ."
"it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist ."
"can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band ."
"I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band ."
"I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music ."
"nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing ."
"I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice ."
"you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music ."
"that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . "
"Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check ."
"Wow , what a great burd !"
"She sure knows how to strut her stuff ."
"She's a real turn-on our rights ."
"And look out she's dressed ."
"Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded ."
"No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants ."
"Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful ."
"I think you've lost it ."
"Well , that's my opinion ."
"I admit that she is much prettier than Kate ."
"Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly ."
"At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . "
"What do you think of doctor Thompson ?"
"I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease ."
"How can you be so sure ?"
"I can tell from the way he spoke to us ."
"Never believe his words . "
"Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ?"
"Fine , just fine . Thanks ."
"Doing anything for lunch ?"
"Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . "
"What is the correct time , please ?"
"It ’ s exactly twelve minutes past seven ."
"When will you lecture begin ?"
"Begin at 9 o ’ clock sharp . "
"You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen ."
"So you are ."
"And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy ."
"I feel exactly the same way with you ."
"Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse ."
"What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either ."
"You don ’ t love me ?"
"No ."
"But we ’ re so right for each other ."
"I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . "
"Mary , can you help me set the table ?"
"Sure ."
"This is usually my chore ."
"I don't mind helping ."
"We need to set the table for four ."
"So that's four plates , four forks , four knives , and four spoons ?"
"That's right . Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you ."
"Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks . "
"Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good ."
"What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually ."
"It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead ."
"I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed ."
"What did the critic say ?"
"He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it ."
"The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready ."
"Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results ."
"I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . "
"What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ?"
"I like collecting stamps ."
"But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ?"
"Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ?"
"I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best ."
"Do you play basketball well ?"
"No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it ."
"Shall we have a game together some day ?"
"OK , that'd be very nice . "
"That looks like an interesting book ."
"It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on ."
"There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though ."
"They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides ."
"Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before ."
"Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape ."
"Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical ."
"This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval ."
"What sports do they play there ?"
"It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings ."
"Is that building a perfect cube ?"
"According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ?"
"Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . "
"Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?"
"No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough ."
"But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?"
"Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other ."
"Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot ."
"You're welcome . "
"Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ?"
"I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this ."
"What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !"
"Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick ."
"Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain ."
"I am wiped out . Thank you ."
"Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?"
"Never ! But thank you for inviting me ."
"Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . "
"Hey , Daniel , how's it going ?"
"Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class ."
"Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?"
"We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator ."
"Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?"
"Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa ."
"Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?"
"Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty ."
"Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?"
"Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do ."
"You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today ."
"OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it ."
"That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?"
"Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?"
"Exactly , now , tell me the time ."
"I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . "
"This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty ."
"So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it ."
"Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way ."
"You got it . "
"He has lots of hobbies ."
"And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses ."
"He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses ."
"But as for his business in the city ... , He lets his cousins look after his business ."
"He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . "
"Good morning , Miss Li ."
"Morning , Mike ."
"I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday ."
"I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ?"
"I feel much better now ."
"Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?"
"I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks ."
"I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ?"
"I will . "
"Where are we headed now ?"
"To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it ."
"Awesome . Was someone killed there ?"
"Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don ."
"Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ?"
"Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . "
"How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ?"
"Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby ."
"Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ?"
"I like taking photos out of doors ."
"Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby ."
"Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos ."
"You yourself have a photo studio ?"
"Yes , simple as it is . It does work . "
"I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night ."
"Would you like orchestra seats ?"
"Isn't there anything less expensive ?"
"Not unless you want the matinee . "
"We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ?"
"As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies ."
"Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . "
"Hi , Francis ."
"Oh , Mike . How are you doing ?"
"Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart ."
"Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too ."
"Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time ."
"Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you ."
"Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again ."
"Me too . Have a great day . "
"Hi ! What are you watching ?"
"It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting ."
"Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?"
"They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” ."
"Why do they go there ?"
"Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith ."
"When muslims pray , they face towards mecca ."
"That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed ."
"I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone ."
"That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents ."
"Pilgrimages are common in many faiths ."
"Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages ."
"Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?"
"I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there ."
"Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?"
"Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . "
"I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary ."
"It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare ."
"But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work ."
"Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him ."
"This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five ."
"It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . "
"Balista , pull me a ristretto ."
"What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ?"
"It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence ."
"Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead !"
"You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? "
"The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it ."
"Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ?"
"Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together ."
"Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year ."
"Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards ."
"What are the children doing ?"
"They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks ."
"I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year ."
"Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money ."
"Who will get the money ?"
"Of course the children . "
"Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation ."
"I really couldn't understand him ."
"He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him ."
"We'd better leave him alone . "
"At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again !"
"Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport ."
"Do you know any secrets to China's success ?"
"In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions ."
"So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership ."
"Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules ."
"For example ?"
"They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other ."
"Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights !"
"Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . "
"Dad , I'm scared ."
"Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs ."
"But , dad , it's stormy outside ."
"Honey , it's just windy and raining outside ."
"Ar ! Dad , the power went out . "
"I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand ."
"me . too i like the festival best of all ."
"Think of the big face down the eve , hmm ."
"And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play ."
"Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?"
"Such as ... , You know why fire crackers are set off in festival ."
"Why ? to welcome the new year of course ."
"And also to frighten away evil spirits ."
"Really ?"
"And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year ."
"Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels . "
"Mary likes mountain climbing ."
"What ? No kidding !"
"Yes , she's a professional climber ."
"I can't believe it ! "
"You must be feeling terrible for Mary ."
"Yes , she's been like this for two weeks ."
"I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class ."
"So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . "
"Jack , what do you think about the election ?"
"I think the campaign is a blockbuster ."
"How many people have flung their hats into the ring ?"
"Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat ."
"Who do you think will be elected ?"
"It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes ."
"I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech ."
"Maybe . Who knows ? "
"May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law ."
"Yeah . That's just what is troubling John ."
"Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread ."
"This situation isn't easy to handle . "
"Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 ."
"It's 8 sharp by my watch ."
"Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . "
"Holly , I just heard some terrible news ."
"Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor ."
"What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it ."
"That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us ."
"Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ?"
"No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! "
"Hi , Kate ."
"Hi , Don . What a surprise !"
"Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now ."
"Have you noticed what has changed ?"
"Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ?"
"Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds ."
"Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break ."
"What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday ."
"Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that ."
"Sure . Join my class next week . "
"Hello , Jack.It ' s good of you to come ."
"The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day !"
"Thank you , Jack.To be frank , I'd rather forget my birthday ."
"Don't be silly . "
"What's your favorite magazine ?"
"Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite ."
"What kind of magazine is it ?"
"It's instructive and inspiring ."
"Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ?"
"No , it's a semimonthly ."
"Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?"
"Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores ."
"Oh , I think I should try to read one . "
"Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ?"
"Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows ."
"Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me ."
"It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it ."
"Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions ."
"Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch ."
"She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !"
"She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . "
"We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year ."
"Whose name did you pick ?"
"I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?"
"Booze !"
"Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . "
"So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?"
"Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore ."
"That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather ."
"What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ?"
"It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?"
"My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . "
"Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations ."
"I really couldn't understand him ."
"He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him ."
"We'd better also leave him alone . "
"Would you like to go to a party tonight ?"
"That sounds like a good idea ."
"Would 7:00 be OK ?"
"That's fine . I'm looking forward to it . "
"hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ?"
"hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ?"
"who ’ s it about ?"
"it ’ s about bob Dylan ."
"who is he ?"
"he ’ s a famous American musician ."
"who ’ s the author ?"
"it was written by Howard sounds ."
"what do you think about it ?"
"it ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot form reading it ."
"can I read it when you ’ re done ?"
"sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished ."
"how many chapters does the book have ?"
"there are 15 chapters in total ."
"when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ?"
"I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then ."
"thanks . Charlie !"
"no problem . Bob . "
"Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 !"
"Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ?"
"Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? "
"Where are you planning on transferring to ?"
"I can ’ t seem to make a decision ."
"Where do you want to go ?"
"I honestly have no idea ."
"You haven ’ t thought about it ?"
"I like it here at PCC ."
"Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ?"
"I like that idea ."
"It ’ s a great school ."
"I completely agree ."
"So , have you made your decision yet ?"
"I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at . "
"Any plans tonight ?"
"Not really , do you ?"
"Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview ."
"Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ?"
"I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me ."
"That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ?"
"Just did my best . "
"In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house ."
"Who do you think that has the motive ?"
"I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations ."
"OK , murder will out !"
"Yeah . "
"David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?"
"I ’ m not in the mood ."
"Why are you feeling depressed ?"
"I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down ."
"I don ’ t think she will do such a thing ."
"But she did and made me disappointed ."
"Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything ."
"But she means a lot to me ."
"Then forgive her mistake ."
"Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . "
"Which university did you graduate from ?"
"I graduated from Songhua University ."
"When did you graduate ?"
"I graduated from it in 2002 . "
"You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith ."
"Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil ."
"I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that ."
"Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . "
"What do you think of smoking ?"
"It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others ."
"What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?"
"Stop producing cigarettes ."
"But that ’ ll affect the national economy ."
"That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways ."
"How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ?"
"Maybe it can take effect . "
"How did you spend the weekend ?"
"I went to a movie with my boyfriend ."
"Really ? How was it ?"
"It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors ."
"Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?"
"Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving ."
"Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?"
"The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you ."
"Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend ."
"It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . "
"Would you like to come out with me tonight ?"
"Sorry , I can ’ t ."
"Tomorrow night , then ?"
"I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t ."
"I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then ."
"That ’ s sounds great ."
"Ok . How about give me a ring , then ?"
"No . I ’ d better not ."
"Why not ?"
"Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . "
"My goodness ! You ’ re kidding !"
"No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job ."
"That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ?"
"It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities ."
"Come on ! Don ’ t be silly !"
"Your present job is something better . Why do you change ?"
"Well . How do you know ? "
"Hello , Anna speaking !"
"Hey , Anna , this is Jason ."
"Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?"
"Yes . How are you , Anna ?"
"I am fine . What have you been doing ?"
"Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion ."
"That's great , congratulations !"
"Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant ."
"That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you ."
"You are kidding ."
"How long have you been working there ?"
"A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions ."
"How do you like your new boss ?"
"She is very nice and open-minded ."
"Much better than the last one , huh ?"
"Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots ."
"Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk ."
"Good . Tonight 8 o'clock ."
"8 it is . See you then ."
"Bye . "
"Why are you walking to and fro in the room ?"
"I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us ."
"Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups ."
"I know . But I couldn ’ t help . "
"Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad ."
"I just lost my job . My boss just told me ."
"That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?"
"I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money ."
"I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . "
"Your father looks much younger in the picture ."
"He was 20 years old then ."
"How old is he now ?"
"He's over sixty . "
"Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy ."
"Nice to meet you , I'am Simon . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before ."
"No , I just started working here at IBM , I am in the sale department ."
"What do you do there ?"
"I main market reasearch , and you ?"
"I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him ."

"Yes , That's him over there - the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ?"
"Thanks , that's would be lovely.You ' r right , he is kind and nice looking . "
"Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag ."
"What is it ?"
"He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death ."
"Don't you like to know anything about stocks ?"
"I'm not at all keen on this subject . "
"Could you do me a favour ? I don ’ t understand this French document ."
"Oh , this is over my head . It ’ s too professional . "
"Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ?"
"OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ?"
"Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant ."
"Are you well paid ?"
"Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening , Not bad ."
"Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it ."
"That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss ."
"There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job ."
"That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot ."
"Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me ."
"Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know ."
"First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' , Be a yes-man , you mean ?"
"You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem ."
"I hope not . "
"Hi , Tim , any news about your job interview ?"
"Yeah , I didn't get the job in the end ."
"Oh , what a pity !"
"It's ok , that's life . "
"Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ?"
"No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news ."
"Indeed , we got married too soon ."
"Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ?"
"Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time ."
"How's your married life ?"
"We're happy together now ."
"I have to say you're a well-matched couple ."
"Thank you ! "
"What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ?"
"Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with ."
"The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ?"
"It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues ."
"Sounds like you really learned a lot ."
"I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . "
"Every teacher likes him ."
"They say he can sum up like winking ."
"How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me ."
"Maybe he's gifted in that . "
"There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know ."
"What ?"
"She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week ."
"What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ?"
"Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy ."
"Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! "
"I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble ."
"That ’ s alright . "
"Do you know where Helen is ?"
"She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday ."
"That reminds me . My wedding anniversary is tomorrow . "
"Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J , That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it ."
"But it's unfair for Jane . "
"I'm back ."
"What have you done ?"
"Going shopping . It tires me too much ."
"Why don't you go shopping online ?"
"Can I ?"
"Why not ? Let me recommend a website ."
"OK . What does it sell ?"
"It sells almost everything you can see in the department ."
"That's great . "
"Hey Nick , what are you up to ?"
"Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?"
"Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man ."
"Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you , Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !"
"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be , Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !"
"The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?"
"Let ’ s do it ! "
"It's one of the highlights of the match ."
"What ?"
"The wonderful passing Melaena did ."
"Too bad I missed it . "
"Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?"
"yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day ."
"good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time ."
"yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... , is everything ready now ?"
"almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive ."
"have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job ."
"yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet ."
"it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive ."
"that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception ."
"I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available ."
"thank you ."
"my pleasure . "
"Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment ."
"You moved to a new place ?"
"Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come ."
"Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ?"
"It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance ."
"Who else will come ?"
"I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him ."
"Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ?"
"Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . "
"What brings you to Beijing ?"
"I'm here on business . "
"Happy new year !"
"Thank you . Same to you ."
"Have you got any plans ?"
"I've been invited over to a friend's , and you ?"
"My roommate's having a party . "
"When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?"
"Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter ."
"How about Sunday then ?"
"Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?"
"Does six thirty suit you ?"
"It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then ."
"Thanks , goodbye . "
"How can I live without Helen ?"
"Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . "
"I don't dare ask Jane for a date ."
"You've got no guts ! "
"Japanese is easy to learn ."
"You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard ."
"I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese ."
"You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . "
"Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet ."
"Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me ."
"Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet ."
"There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services ."
"That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered ."
"Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . "
"What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . "
"How was your holiday to Cyprus ?"
"It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home ."
"Did you happen to meet someone ?"
"How did you know ?"
"You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ?"
"His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there ."
"Was it love at first sight ?"
"Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went ."
"And ?"
"Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love ."
"That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ?"
"Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated ."
"It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?"
"Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen . "
"what do you hope to do when you finish university ?"
"I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ?"
"after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide , we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions ."
"if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored ."
"unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed ."
"that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic ."
"as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong ."
"I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it ."
"my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field ."
"I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . "
"Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ?"
"Total Fitness , why ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there ."
"Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good ."
"The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time ."
"Oh , it ’ s one of those places ."
"Yeah , is your club different ?"
"Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people ."
"Do they have a lot of equipment ?"
"Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna ."
"Sounds nice . What about classes ?"
"The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too ."
"Wow , that sounds great ."
"Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ?"
"Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work ."
"Perfect . See you later ."
"O . K ."
"see you . "
"Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ?"
"No , I only know four great beauties of China ."
"There were some famous ugly women in history ."
"Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ?"
"Though they were ugly , they had great virtue ."
"Then who were they ?"
"Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected ."
"It seems that the inner beauty is also important ."
"Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . "
"I wonder how Sarah and Mat are ."
"Don't you know they've already broken up ?"
"I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane ."
"And he's so handsome . "
"Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be ."
"True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles ."
"I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % ."
"The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat ."
"But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . "
"I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand ."
"Me too . I like the festival best of all ."
"Think of the big face down the eve , hmm ."
"And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play ."
"Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?"
"Such as ?"
"You know why fire crackers are set off in festival ."
"Why ? To welcome the new year of course ?"
"And also to frighten away evil spirits ."
"Really ?"
"And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year ."
"Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . "
"Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ?"
"Oh , that scared me ."
"The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake ."
"Oh , dear ! How ruthless !"
"Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ?"
"Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . "
"It's really late but I'm starving ."
"Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on ."
"Maybe they have some good pie ."
"I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun ."
"There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate ."
"Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once ."
"Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked ."
"Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! "
"How have you been ?"
"Fine , thank you ."
"And how ’ s everyone in your family ?"
"Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ?"
"I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . "
"How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ?"
"It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income ."
"Yes , so I think she is suitable for you ."
"But , well ... what I want to say is ... , Stop acting like this . Say away !"
"Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that ."
"What did she say ?"
"She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents ."
"Give her up . "
"I love that vase ."
"Do you really like it ?"
"Yes , it looks perfect ."
"It wasn't very expensive either ."
"That's amazing ! "
"I heard that Ann had divorced ."
"I suspect it's unavoidable ."
"Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all ."
"Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . "
"how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ?"
"well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up ."
"what do you have for breakfast ?"
"I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast ."
"that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?"
"I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about , how do you spend your afternoons ?"
"I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time "
"People are funny ."
"They sure are ."
"Did you hear about the pilot ?"
"The one that stole a small plane ?"
"Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S ."
"Did they catch him ?"
"Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway ."
"Did he crash ?"
"No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant ."
"Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ?"
"His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down ."
"Poor guy . "
"Did you watch the Premiership last night ?"
"Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match ."
"No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it ."
"Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye ."
"Which team do you back then ?"
"I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking ."
"But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . "
"What's your major in college ?"
"I take architecture as my major ."
"What research are you dealing with now ?"
"I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . "
"Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ?"
"Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk ."
"The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought ."
"Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago ."
"That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith ."
"Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry ."
"I'm really sick ! "
"I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ?"
"Not really ."
"They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old ."
"Please don't tell me you bought it ."
"Why not ?"
"If you did , you probably got ripped off . "
"Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ?"
"Sure . What do you want to know ?"
"Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ?"
"Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses ."
"OK . And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ?"
"It can be completed in four years normally ."
"I see . Thank you very much ."
"You're welcome . "
"I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ?"
"You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . "
"Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?"
"I'd like to very much ."
"All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall ."
"Who's playing ?"
"It's the Powell orchestra ."
"Do you know what they are playing ?"
"They're doing a seventeenth-century program ."
"And who is directing ?"
"Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
"Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million ."
"I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million ."
"What if I said no ?"
"Ever hear of WebTracker ?"
"You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing ."
"I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich ."
"OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . "
"We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot ."
"Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings !"
"OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ?"
"Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ?"
"Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! "
"Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy ."
"Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself ."
"This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good ."
"I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine ."
"Would you like another beer ?"
"I'II have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me ."
"Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !"
"Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon . "
"Hi , Bob , everything okay ?"
"more or less . There's just one thing bothering me ."
"oh ? What's that ?"
"well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy ."
"what gift ?"
"it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift , you refused the gift ? That's terrible ."
"I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way ."
"perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade ."
"that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . "
"Hi , Mike , what gives ?"
"Hi , Bill , this is my new car ."
"Hey , great set of wheels ."
"You like it , huh ?"
"Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world ."
"It is special , isn't it ?"
"Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?"
"Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years ."
"I can imagine ."
"Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out ."
"I'd love to ."
"Ok , let's go . "
"We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ?"
"I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion ."
"It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic ."
"Well , I'll try gin and tonic . "
"My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ?"
"Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 ."
"You sneak !"
"I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him !"
"But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! "
"Do you have any habits such as smoking ?"
"No , I rarely smoke . I don't drink , either . I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends ."
"What kind of winter sport do you like best ?"
"My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball ."
"What do you like doing in your spare time ?"
"I like doing aerobics in my spare time . It's good for my health ."
"Do you have any hobbies ?"
"Yes , I have . I collect stamps , Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries . "
"I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little ."
"That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ?"
"Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?"
"Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it ."
"I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . "
"Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ?"
"Yes , I'm sure I've been here before ."
"Maybe we're walking in circles ."
"Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . "
"I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out ."
"70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . "
"What a beautiful day !"
"It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain ."
"I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today ."
"Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ?"
"Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York ."
"Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . "
"I have no idea about what to do next ."
"Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks ."
"Let me have a try . "
"Do you feel better ?"
"Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me ."
"Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine ."
"Thanks a lot . You are so kind . "
"Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ?"
"Why do I need to do that ?"
"My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect ."
"Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ?"
"My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ?"
"Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere ."
"That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ?"
"Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . "
"Which team has won ?"
"Neither.The game ended in two all ."
"But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized ."
"But the Brazilian is tougher . "
"I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?"
"Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife ."
"What ?"
"His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion ."
"Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well ."
"Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it ’ s just one of those things . "
"Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ?"
"That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on ."
"I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that ."
"Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ?"
"Well how about meeting at my place ?"
"That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . "
"Show us our itineraries , please ."
"We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet ."
"How long will the trip take ?"
"At least 20 days . "
"Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ?"
"What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?"
"Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night ."
"Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! "
"Which service offered by your bank do you use most ?"
"I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see ."
"Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around ."
"I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash ."
"Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit ."
"Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines ."
"That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too ."
"Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others ."
"I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher ."
"I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use ."
"That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . "
"I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?"
"Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices ."
"The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first ."
"Why not start with the most interesting one ?"
"Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision ."
"Toss a coin to decide then . "
"You know John ?"
"Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper ."
"And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam ."
"I wish he could too ."
"How ’ s your boy , Jack ?"
"He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up ."
"Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ?"
"Good luck to them . "
"You're from New York , aren't you ?"
"Yes , that's right ."
"What do you suggest I should see in New York ?"
"Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?"
"No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring ."
"Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?"
"Ah ! That sounds interesting . "
"Are you getting overtime ?"
"Yes , but it's not so appetizing ."
"Have you thought about another job ?"
"That's what's hanging on my mind recently . "
"I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club ."
"Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ?"
"Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !"
"Cool !"
"I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... , So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ?"
"No . I borrowed it to go shopping . "
"Quite a few people are laid off these days ."
"Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job ."
"University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market , It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ?"
"No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . "
"Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ?"
"Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again ."
"Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ?"
"Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . "
"Mike's really angry ."
"I wonder Why . "
"Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful ."
"Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?"
"Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ?"
"Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge ."
"The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?"
"Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed ."
"When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree ."
"Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect ."
"Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . "
"Listen to this . Mary got married ."
"Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it !"
"Yes . Yesterday ."
"Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !"
"She married Jerrod ."
"You ’ re kidding ."
"She ’ s going to live in Paris ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised . "
"I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team !"
"That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . "
"What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ?"
"As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education ."
"There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills ."
"The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others ."
"I noticed that too . What are the people learning ?"
"In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management ."
"I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future ."
"That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ?"
"Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper ."
"Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well ."
"They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . "
"are you good at making decisions ?"
"not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me ."
"what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ?"
"there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something , your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak , that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ?"
"I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea ."
"ok , i choose luckies ."
"you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already ! "
"Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin ."
"Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat ."
"Maybe you are right . "
"I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow ."
"Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered ."
"What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ?"
"You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard ."
"I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ?"
"You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! "
"Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat !"
"Wow ! Sure !"
"I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch ."
"Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying !"
"I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about ."
"I'd love to help if I can ."
"Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !"
"Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain ."
"But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ?"
"Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know ."
"I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name ."
"Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ?"
"I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans ."
"I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think ."
"Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare ."
"Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . "
"Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know ."
"I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . "
"This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ?"
"Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently ."
"For example ?"
"Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to ."
"I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally ."
"You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago !"
"Well , I have no regrets !"
"I ’ ll drink to that ! "
"Hello , Deva , how are you ?"
"Can't complain . What about you ?"
"Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?"
"I've heard . She looks quite depressed ."
"Yes . They used to be joined at the hip ."
"I heard they were just married for 5 months ."
"Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things ."
"Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden ."
"You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage ."
"Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married ."
"Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners ."
"Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce ."
"We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners ."
"That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . "
"hi , betty !"
"hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ?"
"pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great ."
"that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ?"
"well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don , that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work ."
"indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees ."
"that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that ."
"true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything ."
"well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good ."
"yeah it is . "
"I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations !"
"Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding ."
"I'm looking forward to it . "
"Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ?"
"No , I'm scared of cats ."
"Oh , but why ?"
"I feel they're dirty . "
"I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans ."
"Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years ."
"I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle ."
"I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you ."
"No-one really believes gossip columnists ."
"I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it , I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people ."
"That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?"
"I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity ."
"You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - , Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . "
"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?"
"No , I'm not clear ."
"we've spent $ 1,000 ."
"Don't make a fuss.The price is rising "
"Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance ."
"Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross ."
"That's really a good thing . Let's do our part ."
"Good idea ."
"Who will sing in the show ?"
"A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... , Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !"
"Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself ."
"Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile ."
"She is a real star . Not a onetime thing ."
"But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !"
"Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things ."
"You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her ."
"Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?"
"Here is the programme . Check it out yourself !"
"OK . "
"What's your hobby ?"
"Photograph ."
"What's the make of your camera ?"
"Olympus ."
"Do you own your own darkroom ?"
"No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements ."
"Why ?"
"Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . "
"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair ."
"Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living ."
"That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified ."
"I guess I never thought of that before ."
"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government ."
"Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! "
"I haven't met you at the gym for a long time ."
"yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out ."
"why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening ."
"it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night ."
"then SOHO is your ideal work style ."
"yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace ."
"and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control ."
"absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself ."
"sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ?"
"yeah , I can find enough online ."
"it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit ."
"thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . "
"What did you say when she told you the news ?"
"I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal ."
"But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that ."
"How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . "
"How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ?"
"In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family ."
"But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ?"
"You are deadly right . "
"Tom's new business will do well ."
"I don't think so . There's too much competition . "
"Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ?"
"Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ?"
"Who ’ s it about ?"
"It ’ s about Bob Dylan ."
"Who is he ?"
"He ’ s a famous American musician ."
"Who ’ s the author ?"
"It was written by Howard Sounds ."
"What do you think about it ?"
"It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it ."
"Can I read it when you ’ re done ?"
"Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished ."
"How many chapters does the book have ?"
"There are 15 chapters in total ."
"When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ?"
"I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then ."
"Thanks . Charlie !"
"No problem . Bob . "
"Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms !"
"I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble ."
"Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high !"
"No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ?"
"Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest ."
"That's exactly where I was planning to go !"
"Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . "
"I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend ."
"I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently ."
"How might you spend the weekend ."
"I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing ."
"I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf ."
"I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely ."
"Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends ."
"Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true ."
"Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . "
"Do you drink the Robust Milk every day ?"
"Not every day , but occasionally ."
"It will make you as fit as a fiddle ."
"I don't believe ads.What ' s more , I'm already in perfect health . "
"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?"
"Poor , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?"
"It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day ."
"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? "
"Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ?"
"I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross ."
"Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?"
"For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !"
"Have you treated any real emergencies ?"
"Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !"
"I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! "
"Hello ?"
"Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office ."
"Good morning ."
"The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week ."
"Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday ."
"She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand ."
"Is there someone else I can talk to ?"
"She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ?"
"Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me ."
"Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ?"
"I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda ."
"I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ?"
"That will be fine ."
"Ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . See you then . "
"Have a nice weekend !"
"Thanks.You too !"
"Do you have any plans ?"
"Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ?"
"Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . "
"There are so many record players here.That is hard to choose ."
"Look at this one.It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers ."
"I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound ."
"Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big.Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture ."
"That's right.Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony ."
"Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . "
"Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ?"
"You tried to seduce me . I fell for you ."
"By the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ?"
"I am just thinking of it . Maybe I ’ ll go . "
"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them ."
"I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it ."
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?"
"I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films ."
"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin , Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea , I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored ."
"I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves , Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . "
"Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson ."
"Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?"
"Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting ."
"I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable ."
"Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !"
"Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche ."
"How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love ."
"You have always been so soft , Dave !"
"Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out ."
"Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! "
"Hi , Walter !"
"Hi , Sterling !"
"What do you think of our new teacher ?"
"Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist ."
"You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?"
"I guess so . "
"It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... , Miss !"
"Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... , My name is Jane Brown !"
"Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . "
"Who's that ?"
"Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause ."
"Is that your cousin in the back ?"
"Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church ."
"What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ?"
"Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family ."
"And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . "
"Hi , Lander . What's wrong ?"
"I can hardly make ends meet these days ."
"Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months ."
"My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise ."
"True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities ."
"Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . "
"You look a bit dull today . What's up ?"
"Well , my mum lost her job yesterday ."
"I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women ."
"The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole ."
"Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ?"
"Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community ."
"That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually ."
"Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . "
"This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink ."
"Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe ."
"Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ?"
"The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids ."
"So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages ."
"That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids ."
"Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . "
"Hi , Nancy.How are you doing ?"
"Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ?"
"Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up ."
"Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ?"
"You mean used car ?"
"No , Ah ... single sellers ."
"Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem ."
"Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now ."
"It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get ."
"Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car ."
"Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? "
"I heard that Ann had divorced ."
"I suspect it's unavoidable ."
"Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all ."
"Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . "
"How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ?"
"Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones , May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ?"
"Possibly . "
"Mary , today is a great day for you ."
"How nice of you to remember !"
"Oh , here's a little token of my affection ."
"You're so thoughtful.Thank you . "
"An interesting meeting , isn't it ?"
"Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good ."
"Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley ."
"How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent ."
"Sorry , what was your last name again ?"
"It's Nugent , N-U-G-E-N-T , but just call me Ted ."
"Ok , I'm Tom ."
"Glad to meet you ."
"And what do you do , Ted ?"
"Me ? I'm in the car business ."
"Salesman ?"
"Yes , that's right . And how about you ?"
"I work for American Airlines ."
"Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ?"
"I'm in the Personnel Department . "
"My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that ."
"What does his dad say ?"
"John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand . "
"You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ?"
"Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts ."
"Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures ."
"And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart ."
"Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?"
"Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn ."
"What does he look like ? Can people tell ?"
"Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . "
"Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?"
"I'd like to very much ."
"All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall ."
"Who's playing ?"
"It's the Powell orchestra ."
"Do you know what they are playing ?"
"They're doing a seventeenth-century program ."
"And who is directing ?"
"Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
"Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?"
"Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run ."
"What ’ s the score ?"
"Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base ."
"So Baltimore is winning ?"
"Right ."
"This is a really great place to watch a baseball game ."
"Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place ."
"The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia ."
"It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game ."
"Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . "
"Have the aerobic classes any effect on you ?"
"Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 ."
"Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . "
"You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you ."
"Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson ."
"Tim , please . Please be seated ."
"Thank you ."
"So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years ready for change ?"
"Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . "
"What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ?"
"I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out ."
"That's too bad . What happened ?"
"Well ... that's a long story . "
"Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it ."
"Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ?"
"I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details ."
"What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ?"
"I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences ."
"Why would the person who told have problems with the law ?"
"Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality ."
"I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ?"
"I'm sure management is on top of it . "
"What ’ s your favourite ball sport ?"
"I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV ."
"Who ’ s your favourite player ?"
"I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston ."
"Do they have a good team ?"
"I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach ."
"I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing ."
"I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well ."
"You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table ."
"How many more games are there this season ?"
"We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . "
"I like the kid.He ' s so lovely ."
"How old is he ?"
"Twelve.He ' s very sensible for his age . "
"Time flies !"
"You're telling me . "
"How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days ."
"Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close !"
"I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you !"
"Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . "
"Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ?"
"Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende ."
"Great . What do you think of it ?"
"The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh ."
"Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ?"
"Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it ."
"It sounds great , and is it really cool there ?"
"Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort ."
"What is the special local product ?"
"The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious ."
"I hope to go there someday . "
"Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ?"
"I didn't have any big plans ."
"We are putting together a birthday party for Mary ."
"That sounds like fun . Where will it be ?"
"We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house ."
"Oh good ! Can I bring anything ?"
"We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes ."
"I am assuming that the dress is casual ."
"Dress casually and bring your bathing suit !"
"Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . "
"Do you have any hobbies ?"
"Yes , I like collecting things ."
"Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?"
"Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on ."
"Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?"
"Yes , stones ."
"well , I can ’ t just image it . "
"What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ?"
"Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter , Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ?"
"Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us ."
"Easy . It ’ s on me ."
"In that case , I ’ m right behind you . "
"what did you do over the weekend ?"
"I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment ."
"do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?"
"it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening ."
"like what ?"
"well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start ."
"what else can we do to protect the environment ?"
"if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy ."
"how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?"
"yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center ."
"what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?"
"I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone ."
"I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !"
"to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . "
"Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today !"
"Thank you . I'm wearing make-up ."
"Who taught you to put on make-up ?"
"It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop ."
"Can you teach me how to do make-up ?"
"Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes ."
"What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ?"
"I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls ."
"How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ?"
"I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips ."
"How did you grow such long nails ?"
"You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . "
"Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training ."
"Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week ."
"But for me , the training is waste of my precious time ."
"I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company "
"How will you spend this lovely weekend ?"
"I have no idea , any suggestions ?"
"We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ?"
"It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess ."
"Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win ."
"OK , settled then ."
"See you tomorrow ."
"See you ! "
"Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?"
"Cinct de mayo ?"
"No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day ."
"Do we get a day off from school then ?"
"No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is ."
"Www , man !"
"In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect ."
"Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?"
"Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality ."
"And then what happened ?"
"Well , as we say , the rest is history ... "
"What's that book you have under your arm ?"
"It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months ."
"How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn ."
"I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day ."
"Is it really worth paying for ?"
"I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter ."
"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . "
"You have your ducks in a row ."
"Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ?"
"Sure . There is a folk concert tonight ."
"Are there any good seats left ?"
"Sorry . There are only some seats in the back ."
"Well , what time does it begin ?"
"It begins at 7 p . m .. , OK . I see ."
"How many tickets do you want ?"
"Just two ."
"OK . Fifty yuan for each ."
"Here is the money . "
"We have a live show of a football match this Friday night ."
"What're the teams ?"
"Brazilian against AC Millan ."
"I bet AC Milan will lose . "
"Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ?"
"haven't been sleeping well recently ."
"what's the problem ?"
"every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings ."
"well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down ."
"yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon ."
"I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept , yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . "
"You ’ re all set now ?"
"Oh , thank you so much ."
"Really , it was nothing ."
"I really appreciated it ."
"I was happy to help ."
"It was so kind of you ."
"Don ’ t mention it ."
"You ’ re a real friend in need . "
"Haven't seen you for a long time , I've been away on a vacation ."
"I bet you had a wonderful time , Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends , Sounds great "
"I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping ."
"Yes ."
"If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch ."
"I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . "
"Has the game started yet ?"
"Yeah , about 5 minutes ago ."
"Who's winning ?"
"The Bulls , of course !"
"What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref !"
"Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws ."
"You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot !"
"That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah !"
"Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !"
"This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !"
"Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . "
"wow , it that your sports car ?"
"yes , do you like it ?"
"I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?"
"it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again ."
"what's wrong with it ?"
"well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive ."
"when's the last time you had it serviced ?"
"it must have been a few years ago now ."
"I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis ."
"they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !"
"what else is wrong with it ?"
"the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !"
"anything else ?"
"the brakes don't really work that well anymore either ."
"why don't you get it all fixed ?"
"it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !"
"well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! "
"Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ?"
"Speaking . Who's calling , please ?"
"Hi , Mary . This is Tom ."
"Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ?"
"Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?"
"Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free ."
"Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ?"
"Sounds like a good idea ."
"Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 ."
"Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . "
"Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?"
"I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting ."
"So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? "
"I don't want to do the damn dishes ."
"Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . "
"Good morning , Paul !"
"Hi , good morning , you are so early today ."
"Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier ."
"I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ?"
"Well , about an hour or so ."
"Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ?"
"No . I take public transportation . It's safer ."
"You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle ."
"Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . "
"I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends ."
"Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it ."
"Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ?"
"I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . "
"Do you believe in UFO's ?"
"Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs ."
"I've never thought about it like that before ."
"I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up ."
"Do you think that there's life on other planets ?"
"I think there must be ."
"Why is that ?"
"I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that ."
"Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?"
"No , but we're trying to contact them ."
"I suppose you're right ."
"I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct ."
"Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?"
"There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . "
"What do you think of shopping ?"
"I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs ."
"What do you think of big department store ?"
"It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit ."
"Are you a professor ?"
"What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old !"
"Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ?"
"Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well ."
"Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know ."
"It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk ."
"Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university ."
"My permission letter ?"
"Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place ."
"I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office ."
"Yes . Or you can bring it yourself ."
"But I asked them to send it to you directly ."
"Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it ."
"My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R ."
"Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request ."
"Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ?"
"The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening ."
"I see . Thank you ."
"You're very welcome . "
"I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features ."
"Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed ."
"Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them ."
"Is that type of plant found in this country ?"
"No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action ."
"So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ?"
"They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another ."
"That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too ."
"That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species ."
"I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions ."
"According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation ."
"That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . "
"I have some good news for you ."
"What's that ?"
"Jenny is getting married ."
"Great ! Who's the bridegroom ?"
"Tom , that lucky guy ."
"The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ?"
"Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her ."
"My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ?"
"July 4 , the National Holiday ."
"Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ?"
"Jenny plans to hold it in church ."
"Who is the best man ?"
"Guess !"
"Nobody is OK , but you !"
"You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man ."
"Did you promise him ?"
"Yes , I did . "
"Peter , have you finished your English composition ?"
"No . But I ’ m working on it ."
"Class starts in twenty minutes . You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today ."
"I know . I know !"
"Do you think you can finish it on time ?"
"Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished ."
"You ’ d better hurry !"
"Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me ."
"Sorry ! "
"How do I apply to an American university ?"
"You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one ."
"I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply ."
"That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars ."
"What's to come next ?"
"If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing ."
"How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?"
"From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well ."
"Thank you . I appreciate all your help ."
"You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . "
"Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you ."
"Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine ."
"You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?"
"No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent ."
"Do you ever get lonely living alone ?"
"Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! "
"Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ?"
"You mean Armistice Day ."
"Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day ."
"Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . "
"These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life ."
"Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions ."
"That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards ."
"I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . "
"I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ?"
"Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ?"
"It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years ."
"Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ?"
"Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II ."
"I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for ."
"Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world ."
"I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games ."
"Sure . "
"One of my students told me she was very depressed today ."
"Why ?"
"Her father is dying ."
"Oh , that ’ s very sad ."
"Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid ."
"What did you do ?"
"I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her ."
"That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things ."
"Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own ."
"Yeah , me too . "
"It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it , Oh . Yes . It is , Shall I light the stove ?"
"That ’ s a good idea , Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ?"
"It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant ."
"Which season do you like best ?"
"I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics "
"I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ?"
"Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ?"
"Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you ."
"I'm a little nervous !"
"I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back ."
"How Ay people will be there at dinner ?"
"Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters ."
"That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . "
"Are you studying any languages here ?"
"Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department ."
"What are you majoring in ?"
"I'm majoring in English ."
"Is it difficult to learn ?"
"Yes.The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting ."
"Do you know anything about Britain and America ?"
"I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture ."
"Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well ."
"You're right . "
"And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries !"
"Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome !"
"And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage ."
"You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high ."
"I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music ."
"You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! "
"Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ?"
"From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks ."
"do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ?"
"I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power ."
"What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?"
"Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . "
"He has to deliver letters every day ."
"Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it ."
"Oh , no , he likes the job ."
"Oh , Really ? "
"Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland ."
"Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !"
"Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing ."
"All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !"
"Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous ."
"Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot ."
"It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it ."
"Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! "
"Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam ."
"I was the only one who got a strait A in my class ."
"Congratulations on your success ."
"Thank you . "
"Mr . Clinton , it's nice to see you again ."
"Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?"
"Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ?"
"Not bad . But she's as busy as before . "
"Has the game started yet ?"
"Yeah , about 5 minutes ago ."
"Who's winning ?"
"The Bulls , of course !"
"What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref !"
"Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws ."
"You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot !"
"That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah !"
"Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !"
"This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !"
"Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . "
"Are you ready to go shopping ?"
"Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet ."
"What research ?"
"Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?"
"But they're just ads ... , Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ... "
"I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now ."
"Out of sight , out of mind ."
"Who do you mean ?"
"Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ? "
"What's the name of the singer who sings this song ?"
"I can't remember ."
"It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' . "
"Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ?"
"Yes . Do you want to go with me ?"
"OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium ."
"Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ?"
"Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart ."
"That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life ."
"How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage ."
"He's going to make the opening speech . "
"Mark is parade his knowledge again ."
"Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge ."
"A well-learned person never does that . "
"They are professors and government officials ."
"Where are they from ?"
"Most of them are from America and Europe ."
"What are they doing in Beijing ?"
"They are attending an international conference here ."
"Which hotel are they staying at ?"
"They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . "
"Where to , miss ?"
"Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner ."
"Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ?"
"From China ."
"Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so ."
"It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products ."
"Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?"
"Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ?"
"Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !"
"Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?"
"I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage ."
"Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?"
"Uh ... yeah .. of course ! "
"Hello , Is this EYE computers ?"
"Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ?"
"Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty ."
"Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ?"
"Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably ."
"Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can . "
"I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive !"
"Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally ."
"Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ?"
"Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please !"
"Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth ."
"Alright . What is that you want to tell me ?"
"We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation !"
"What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere . "
"I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... , Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ?"
"Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones ."
"So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ?"
"Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free !"
"Let me see it ! It's so small ! "
"Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again ."
"Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ?"
"Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ?"
"You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . "
"There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs ."
"I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans ."
"I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more ."
"I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying ."
"I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway ."
"Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign ."
"I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something ."
"That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . "
"Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street ."
"Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ?"
"Yes , definitely ."
"They have moved to some other places long time ago ."
"Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China ."
"Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here ."
"This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere ."
"Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket ."
"Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then ."
"Is that better now ?"
"Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . "
"You ’ re new here , right ?"
"Yes , I am new ."
"Is this your first semester ?"
"I just transferred from another school ."
"What school did you transfer from ?"
"I came here from PCC ."
"Do you like it here so far ?"
"I am really enjoying it here so far ."
"Which is better , here or PCC ?"
"I think PCC is a lot better than here ."
"Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ?"
"I graduated and now want to get a BA . "
"Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize ."
"Great ! This calls for a celebration . "
"Can you imagine having a million dollars ?"
"Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on ."
"Yeah , me too ."
"A new car for a start . "
"David , what do you want to do after graduation ?"
"I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ?"
"That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account ."
"It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing ."
"You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . "
"How come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ?"
"I've been having a hard time sleeping lately ."
"As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ?"
"Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful ."
"You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax ."
"You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ?"
"Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress ."
"I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying !"
"You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective ."
"You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class ."
"Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply ."
"That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night !"
"Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! "
"Did you get your grades yet ?"
"Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now ."
"Why ? What happened ?"
"Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 ."
"Ouch . You must be very disappointed ."
"Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have ."
"Why don't you re-take the class next year ?"
"That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ?"
"I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 ."
"My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class ."
"What was your GPA before this semester ?"
"I was sitting happy with a 3.4 ."
"Why did it go down so much ?"
"Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class ."
"What happened to you ?"
"I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time ."
"You better stop slacking off ."
"You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . "
"Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?"
"It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent ."
"It seems that the climate in this country is changing ."
"The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds ."
"I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment ."
"I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem ."
"Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . "
"Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ?"
"Just last week ."
"How was it ?"
"Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time ."
"Well , tell me . What are they like ?"
"They ’ re nice . "
"And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ... , Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !"
"No wonder you're such a wacko ... , Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples !"
"Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... , You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? "
"I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding ."
"I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful ."
"Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement ."
"All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . "
"What do you think of smoking ?"
"It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others ."
"What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?"
"Stop producing cigarettes ."
"But that ’ ll affect the national economy ."
"That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways ."
"How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ?"
"Maybe it can take effect . "
"Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock ."
"What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... , I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that ."
"I see . Where are you now , Li ?"
"Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge ."
"It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ?"
"I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi !"
"That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock ."
"I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting ."
"It doesn't matter.Bye ."
"Bye . "
"This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ?"
"I'd like to introduce myself first ."
"Yes , please ."
"My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . "
"Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ?"
"Yes . I think I'm lucky ."
"Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard ."
"Thank you for saying that . "
"Why is little Billy crying ?"
"He got a scolding . "
"I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation ."
"but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss ."
"I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee ."
"it sounds like you've got a perfect plan ."
"you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise ."
"it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model ."
"yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company ."
"that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ?"
"well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors ."
"sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . "
"Rob lost his bike ."
"What an idiot ! "
"Can you believe the headlines ?"
"What are you reading ?"
"I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King ."
"Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ?"
"He got arrested all right ."
"If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison ."
"Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless ."
"I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire ."
"That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail ."
"I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . "
"do you believe in UFO's ?"
"sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs ."
"I've never thought about it like that before ."
"I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up ."
"do you think that there's life on other planets ?"
"I think there must be ."
"why is that ?"
"I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that ."
"do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?"
"no , but we're trying to contact them ."
"I suppose you're right ."
"I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct ."
"do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?"
"there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . "
"It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies ."
"Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you ."
"Which country do you want to go to ?"
"My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?"
"Were I in your position , I'd go to America ."
"Which university should I apply to ?"
"There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper ."
"Oh , I see . Thank you very much . "
"It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband ."
"You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ?"
"Someone declared that he saw it ."
"I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ?"
"Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover ."
"Maybe ! "
"When ’ re you getting married ?"
"We planned our wedding for next May ."
"Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ?"
"Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project ."
"That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?"
"Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man ."
"Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . "
"Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't ."
"Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something ."
"What's your meaning ?"
"I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm ."
"You are a thief ?"
"No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables ."
"You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ?"
"You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness ."
"Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . "
"Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now ."
"Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it ."
"Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas ."
"Sure our thing ."
"I do wish your christmas and happy new year ."
"Thanks . "
"How long have you been in Taiwan ?"
"About 3 years , so I came here 2000 ."
"So , where did you grow up ?"
"Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ?"
"I am not sure , where exactly is it ?"
"Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ?"
"No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . "
"I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up ."
"Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again ."
"Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . "
"What's your schedule like this year ?"
"Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year ."
"What's your major ?"
"I ’ m majoring in French literature ."
"Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long ."
"That's right . We got the assignment last week ."
"When is it due ?"
"Next Monday ."
"Remind me never to sign up for that course . "
"Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ?"
"It depends on the weather ."
"The radio says it'll be fine ."
"That'll be great . "
"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker !"
"Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?"
"I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ?"
"Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ?"
"That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ?"
"I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . "
"It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ?"
"I got my father ’ s goat last night ."
"What did you do to get his goat ?"
"When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . "
"We need to elect club officials before the summer starts ."
"I guess we should start with nominees first ."
"Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting ."
"We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared ."
"Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ?"
"Yes , I can do that this afternoon ."
"Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ?"
"Yes , let me put it on the calendar . "
"How's business ?"
"Couldn't be better . "
"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?"
"I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills ."
"Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are ."
"At least you know what American women generally like in a man ."
"Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard ."
"American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances ."
"No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants ."
"You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise ."
"Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . "
"Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' !"
"What's Net Love ?"
"Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love ."
"Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex !"
"Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ?"
"How could you know ?"
"I watched the screen display !"
"Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca !"
"It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA !"
"Impossible ! "
"Tom's dating your sister ."
"Are you sure ? "
"You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ?"
"Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ?"
"I don ’ t think you ’ re right there ."
"I believe industry is making us wealthier ."
"I don ’ t believe that ."
"And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier ."
"I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ?"
"I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago ."
"That ’ s your opinion not mine . "
"How was your date recently ?"
"Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date ."
"I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual ."
"She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating ."
"Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars ."
"But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself ."
"Forget about it !"
"Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ?"
"It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . "
"You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own ."
"If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me ."
"I ’ ll be very glad if you would help ."
"I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture ."
"Thank you . I wish I would ."
"Good luck to you . "
"Do you know who Ammo Hung is ?"
"Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director ."
"You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ?"
"I have no idea . Tell me ."
"In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show ."
"What does he do there ?"
"Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . "
"Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie ."
"I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller ."
"Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards ."
"Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years , Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending ."
"You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end ."
"Oh , really ? How does the book end ?"
"Read it yourself and find out ! "
"Do you know the highest mountain in the world ?"
"Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level ."
"Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth ."
"Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time ."
"Have people set foot on its peak ?"
"Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . "
"I'm feeling down ."
"Come on . Cheer up ! "
"Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ?"
"Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ?"
"Well , when will it be convenient for you ?"
"This weekend would be OK with me . "
"I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices ."
"These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit ."
"Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ?"
"We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition ."
"You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . "
"The city has got a traffic problem ."
"That means it's developing very fast ."
"You said it ."
"Problems are inevitable . "
"Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English ."
"You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you ."
"I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect ."
"Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class.She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though ."
"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . "
"Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ?"
"It was great ! How was your year ?"
"It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ?"
"Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . "
"Your tie is handsome ."
"Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . "
"I failed the exam because I didn't study ."
"Serves you right . "
"Look at that pretty girl ."
"Wow ! She's gorgeous . "
"How do you think people get their personalities ?"
"I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in ."
"Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ?"
"No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot ."
"So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents ."
"Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents ."
"You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv ."
"Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ?"
"Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly ."
"Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too ."
"Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ?"
"Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends ."
"So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . "
"Are you an art aficionado ?"
"Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?"
"I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art ."
"I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school ."
"Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture ."
"I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you ."
"I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there ."
"That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?"
"Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . "
"Labor is an abundant resource here ."
"One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I want to check out these books ."
"I need your library card ."
"I have it right here ."
"It seems you have late fees ."
"Are you sure ?"
"Yes , I ’ m sure ."
"How much ?"
"Your late fees come to $ 24.50 ."
"I don ’ t have that right now ."
"You have to pay it off before you can check out more books ."
"I ’ ll do that soon . "
"The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ?"
"Johnson ? I can't place them ."
"We met them in Bermuda last May ."
"They've completely slipped my mind ."
"The couple with the dogs-think back ."
"No , I don't recall a thing about them ."
"Well , I've invited them for brunch ."
"Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . "
"It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck ."
"Thank you ."
"I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye ."
"Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . "
"What are you going to do for your year abroad , Tim ?"
"Study study study ! I want to learn a lot ."
"You ’ re going to take courses ?"
"Yes , I ’ m going to take some university courses there ."
"Sounds hard ."
"Yes , but I think it ’ s probably for the best ."
"Won ’ t you get lonely ?"
"Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something . "
"You're from New York , aren't you ?"
"Yes , that's right ."
"What do you suggest I should see in New York ?"
"Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?"
"No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring ."
"Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?"
"Ah ! That sounds interesting . "
"I ’ ll sing you a song ."
"Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song ."
"Most of my songs are sad , sorry ."
"Well , please sing one that ’ s not sad ."
"OK , I ’ ll sing San Francisco then . "
"The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words ."
"Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ?"
"He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him ."
"But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ?"
"Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . "
"Do you know where you want to transfer to ?"
"I don ’ t have the slightest clue ."
"What school would you like to go to ?"
"I ’ m not sure ."
"You honestly have no idea ?"
"PCC is perfectly fine for me ."
"You might as well stay here ."
"That ’ s not a bad idea ."
"PCC is a wonderful institution ."
"You have a point ."
"So , what are you going to do ?"
"I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . "
"Hi , Walter !"
"Hi , Sterling !"
"What do you think of our new teacher ?"
"Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist ."
"You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?"
"I guess so . "
"What ?"
"What happened with that guy at the cafe ?"
"nothing , But you ’ re crazy about him ?"
"Yes , I am ."
"Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?"
"I don ’ t actually know him ."
"Really ?"
"I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this ."
"Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ?"
"Yes ."
"Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . "
"It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself ."
"Thanks to your help.To our friendship ."
"Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ?"
"Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us ."
"Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys ."
"I'll surely make introductions for them . "
"To be a revolutionary needs great courage !"
"He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities ."
"Galileo is one of them ."
"So are Copernicus and many others . "
"I think Andy's party will be fun ."
"Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something ."
"What's that ?"
"Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?"
"Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?"
"My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . "
"Hot in here , isn't it ?"
"Yeah , really ."
"Is it Ok if I sit here ?"
"Of course . Suit yourself ."

"Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ?"
"I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ?"
"Sure . Thanks . "
"Where are you going ?"
"It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night ."
"I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it ."
"Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment ."
"What for ?"
"The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills ."
"I really admire you for that . How is it going ?"
"It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . "
"May I ask what the name is the girl ?"
"Which one ?"
"The tallest one ."
"She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother ."
"Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ?"
"OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill ."
"How do you think about her ?"
"She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl ."
"I'm wondering if she has boyfriend ."
"No , she hasn't ."
"Great ! Thank you very much . "
"Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 ."
"Do we have to type out our homework ?"
"Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports ."
"Is there anything else ?"
"Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one ."
"We are allowed to use a calculator in class ?"
"Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . "
"What a wonderful game !"
"Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful ."
"I think John is the best player on the field ."
"He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage ."
"Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . "
"Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !"
"Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !"
"Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !"
"This next one is from Betty ."
"A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !"
"One more from Carla ."
"A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !"
"OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?"
"Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! "
"Susan ? What brings you here today ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due ."
"Really ? So what ’ s the news ?"
"Not too good yet . Better than I was though . "
"I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain ."
"You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall ."
"I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child , Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking "
"Good morning , you look very tired ."
"Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night ."
"Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?"
"No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock ."
"I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges ."
"The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles ."
"Do you have much time watching TV ?"
"I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio ."
"I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station ."
"If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . "
"He told the police that Ted was the murderer ."
"He is playing hob with the fact ."
"Why do you say so ?"
"Because he stayed with me all the time that night . "
"isn't it wonderful walking here ?"
"what do you mean ?"
"I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us ."
"yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall ."
"it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?"
"you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering ."
"what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?"
"quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark , what's there after that ?"
"well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world ."
"what are all they for ?"
"most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . "
"Hi , Daisy !"
"Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again , I hope you are Settling in at school !"
"I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses ."
"Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here ."
"Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies ."
"Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ?"
"Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really ."
"What about your friend Zoe , She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy ."
"Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures ."
"I guess so . What about you , Simon ?"
"I'm studying law ."
"Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer ."
"Sure , welcome anytime "
"Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ?"
"More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly ."
"Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ?"
"I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff ."
"The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group ."
"I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing ."
"Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ?"
"My dad was , but not my mom . "
"Are you studying any languages here ?"
"Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department ."
"What are you majoring in ?"
"I'm majoring in English ."
"Is it difficult to learn ?"
"Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting ."
"Do you know anything about Britain and America ?"
"I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture ."
"Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well ."
"You're right . "
"How are you ?"
"I'm fine thanks . How about you ?"
"I'm okay . What are you doing these days ?"
"Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks ."
"That's great . When are you starting ?"
"Probably in a week or two . I'll let you know . "
"Mary is such a cautious girl !"
"What do you mean by cautious ?"
"She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others ."
"Thats a clever way to escape responsibility . "
"Let ’ s cross here ."
"You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light ."
"Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street ."
"If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters ! "
"Jenny , are you having fun here ?"
"Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines ."
"I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it ."
"Thank you for the invitation ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?"
"Yes , please . Thank you for everything . "
"Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ?"
"No , but we still stay in touch ."
"What's the way you keep in contact ?"
"We contact through email ."
"Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better ."
"Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference ."
"You're right . "
"Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ?"
"It's so faraway ."
"I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 !"
"$ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ... "
"Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ?"
"No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible ."
"Were you celebrating something ?"
"Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails !"
"It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening ."
"I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk ."
"I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints ."
"You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover ."
"Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ?"
"Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine ."
"Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money ."
"Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ?"
"Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... , ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not ."
"Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . "
"Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ?"
"We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? "
"You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol ."
"How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ?"
"Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part ."
"I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him ."
"Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday ."
"Are you a member of his fan club ?"
"I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now ."
"Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?"
"Of course ! I bought two copies ."
"Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? "
"How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet ."
"Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table ."
"I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too ."
"Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive ."
"Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ?"
"They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon ."
"Did they have lobster ?"
"No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet ."
"Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh ."
"I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick ."
"When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ?"
"Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards ."
"Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ?"
"No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . "
"Harry , do you like the opera ?"
"No , not really ."
"Why is that ? It is called real art ."
"Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves ."
"Yeah , that makes sense . "
"May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law ."
"Yeah . That's just what is troubling John ."
"Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread ."
"This situation isn't easy to handle . "
"Judy , what is everybody talking about ?"
"Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager ."
"You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true ."
"Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company ."
"Really ? I ’ m surprised ."
"Me too . "
"Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?"
"It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent ."
"It seems that the climate in this country is changing ."
"The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds ."
"I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment ."
"I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem ."
"Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . "
"What is your favorite pastime ?"
"Fishing . It's great fun ."
"Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings ."
"No wonder you always look so active . "
"hello , Deva , how are you ?"
"can't complain . What about you ?"
"not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?"
"I've heard . She looks quite depressed ."
"Yes . They used to be joined at the hip ."
"I heard they were just married for 5 months ."
"yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things ."
"yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden ."
"you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage ."
"maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married ."
"yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners ."
"definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce ."
"we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners ."
"that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . "
"Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store ."
"Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end ."
"Admit it . You just think of Mussolini ."
"No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli !"
"Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body ."
"Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ?"
"Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . "
"Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious ."
"It's okay ."
"Next time , it's on me ."
"Don't be silly ."
"I'm serious ."
"Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors ."
"Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious ."
"Definitely . I really like Italian food . "
"I really admire you , Diana ."
"Why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue ."
"You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school ."
"I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect ."
"Isn't there anything else ?"
"I have no idea ."
"You must have a high IQ score ."
"Well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret ."
"Go ahead ."
"My IQ score is slightly above average ."
"Seriously ? But you are such a genius ."
"Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure ."
"Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ ."
"You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks ."
"OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ?"
"Let's go ! "
"The academy is an important part of the education system ."
"I couldn't agree with you more . "
"Your father looks much younger in the picture ."
"He was 20 years old then ."
"How old is he now ?"
"He's over sixty . "
"Does anyone need a drink ?"
"I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ?"
"It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers !"
"Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ?"
"No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ?"
"No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . "
"How ’ re you today ?"
"Pretty good , thanks . And you ?"
"What ’ s the main idea in this essay ?"
"The United Nations should have more authority . "
"Hi , Walter !"
"Hi , Sterling !"
"What do you think of our new teacher ?"
"Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist ."
"You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?"
"I guess so . "
"I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit ."
"Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy ."
"If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that ."
"She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? "
"Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ?"
"I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve , That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ?"
"Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout , That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday ."
"It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some "
"What was the last movie you saw ?"
"A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun ."
"Really ? I've seen that movie , too ."
"How did you like the movie ?"
"I thought it was pretty good ."
"Really ? I can't say I agree ."
"You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding ."
"I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed ."
"I guess it could happen . "
"Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling ."
"Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you ."
"Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor ."
"I'll take over for a while to give you a break ."
"Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce ."
"Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! "
"Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?"
"Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe ."
"What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing ."
"Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion ."
"What am I going to do ?"
"Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . "
"What's your favorite sport ?"
"Swimming . What about you ?"
"Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . "
"You are freaking me out ."
"You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! "
"I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug ."
"There's no need to apologize ."
"But I ruined your rug ."
"Forget it . It was an accident . "
"Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !"
"Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester ."
"That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians !"
"That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian ."
"Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture ."
"I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes ."
"Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice ."
"I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese ."
"Well , there is that , yes . "
"Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China ."
"What kind of business do you do ?"
"We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties ."
"What kind of clients do you prefer ?"
"Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry ."
"I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ? "
"I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful ."
"Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled ."
"I hope so . "
"Excuse me , are you Miss Green ?"
"Yes . May I help you ?"
"May I introduce myself ?"
"Yes ."
"I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John ."
"Nice to meet you , John ."
"It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . "
"So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?"
"Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all ."
"That's the Return of the King , right ?"
"Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ?"
"I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me ."
"Did you read the books before you watched the movies ?"
"No . did you ?"
"Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters ."
"Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me ."
"I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home ."
"Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles ."
"That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries ."
"I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars ."
"Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! "
"Jill , how do you like your new job ?"
"I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you ."
"I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details ."
"Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue ."
"Sure , I think I know the place ."
"Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day ."
"That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ?"
"Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there ."
"Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion ."
"No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes ."
"Well I wish you luck . "
"Hey , Jack , where's your car ?"
"I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one ."
"Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ?"
"Hop in , I'll give you a ride ."
"Ok . Boy , this looks expensive ."
"Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?"
"Wow , this thing can haul ."
"Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned ."
"I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails ."
"We are on the high way . Find the pound shade .. , Wow , this car can really burn rubber ."
"It's a great feeling ."
"You made a perfect choice , Jack ."
"Thanks , Daisy . "
"Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !"
"What happened ?"
"I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career !"
"Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ?"
"Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world ."
"Uh-huh ."
"But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? "
"Hello , Ellen ."
"Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident ."
"Oh , no ! What happened ?"
"Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work ."
"How awful ! Was he hurt ?"
"Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance ."
"How did it happen ?"
"His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house ."
"How horrible !"
"He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is ."
"I hope he ’ ll be all right ."
"I hope so , too . "
"My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief ."
"After all , he is a baby ."
"Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . "
"let's go swimming ."
"But , we just finished eating lunch ."
"I know , but I'm really hot ."
"I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming . "
"Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it !"
"Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing ."
"Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy ."
"Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' ."
"Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !"
"Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ?"
"Absolutely ."
"Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?"
"Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages ."
"Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?"
"Yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives ."
"Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information "
"Do you like chocolates ?"
"It depends ."
"Do you like coffee ?"
"Um . It ’ s delicious ."
"And do you like English food ?"
"Not all of it . "
"There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ?"
"Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me ."
"Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one ."
"It is so kind of you , Dad . "
"Could you tell me the time ?"
"Pardon ?"
"What time is it , please ?"
"It's 9:30 . "
"Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick ."
"Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything ."
"Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back ."
"I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative ."
"I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage ."
"You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore ."
"Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings ."
"Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories ."
"Love stories ? More like one-night-stands ."
"Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints ."
"My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?"
"You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . "
"How about going swimming ?"
"Ok . Where should we go ?"
"Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here ."
"Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . "
"Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ?"
"Yes ."
"Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher ."
"Where should I sit ?"
"Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ?"
"Who's Brad ?"
"Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt ."
"When does the first period begin , by the way ?"
"Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . "
"Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat ."
"Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !"
"Thank you ."
"Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?"
"Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library ."
"Excuse me ?"
"Let me show you the way . Please follow me ."
"Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you ."
"My pleasure ."
"This is it ?"
"It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . "
"I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?"
"Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ?"
"I want to have a foot massage and haircut ."
"A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion ."
"Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures ."
"This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !"
"I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ?"
"Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress ."
"Maybe we should try a thai massage too ."
"What ’ s special about a thai massage ?"
"That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet ."
"Sounds painful ! "
"Is Jack still staying idle everyday ?"
"No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order ."
"Really ? He is so competent now ."
"You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . "
"Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women ."
"That's fate ."
"I feel sorry for her ."
"Maybe this is God's will . "
"Hello , ladies . I'm firing up the grill . We can eat in an hour or so ."
"Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ?"
"Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs ."
"Ah ... hence the buns and condiments we bought . And this is Holly's potato salad ."
"You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... , Let me know if I can help . "
"Is Water Shrinking Festival official ?"
"No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official ."
"Don't you think these festivals are more interesting !"
"What an idea ! "
"Hey man , what do you have on tap ?"
"Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special ."
"Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud ."
"Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ?"
"Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks ."
"Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks ."
"Wait ... What ! "
"So you are green with envy at your neighbor ?"
"Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn ."
"But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life ."
"I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life . "
"Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment ."
"You moved to a new place ?"
"Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come ."
"Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ?"
"It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance ."
"Who else will come ?"
"I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him ."
"Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ?"
"Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . "
"Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ?"
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind ."
"That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it ."
"Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . "
"I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping ."
"Chicken ! "
"Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ?"
"Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature ."
"Really ?"
"You bet . You should try it yourself . "
"How was your vacation in Paris ?"
"It was exciting ! "
"What's that book you have under your arm ?"
"It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months ."
"How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn ."
"I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day ."
"Is it really worth paying for ?"
"I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter ."
"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . "
"Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ?"
"You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive ."
"Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ?"
"Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ?"
"Darned right I would !"
"Maybe make-up would be enough ?"
"Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings ."
"But what would other people think ?"
"I don't care what other people think . I am ready for a lift . "
"What are you doing tomorrow ?"
"Nothing really ."
"Let's watch a movie or something ."
"What's on these days ?"
"I think they're playing Lord of the Rings , That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that ."
"Where should we meet ?"
"How about at the subway entrance ."
"Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock . "
"Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye , Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down ."
"I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times ."
"Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know ."
"Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off ."
"Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness ."
"I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... , Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !"
"You are something else you know that ? "
"But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice ."
"Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight ."
"She is pretty . Many men praise her highly ."
"Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . "
"the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off ."
"that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines ."
"great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal ."
"do you prefer brandy or ports ."
"port , please ."
"excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor ."
"the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?"
"yes . You always have a good nose for wines ."
"next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine ."
"oh , what's that ?"
"it's made from naturally frozen grapes ."
"why not ? It sounds great ."
"oh , here's to your health ."
"thanks . Cheers ."
"cheers . "
"My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money ."
"What's changed ?"
"My wife has been pregnant for 7 months ."
"I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy ."
"My wife will be going back to work soon ."
"You should have more money then ."
"Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . "
"Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly ."
"Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully ."
"Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot ."
"No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off ."
"Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you ."
"It's a promise . "
"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?"
"I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !"
"What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?"
"It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?"
"January 5th ."
"Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !"
"That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense ."
"No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize ."
"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?"
"A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! "
"Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ?"
"Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others ."
"Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ?"
"In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago ."
"I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system ."
"I bet nobody will care about it . "
"Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are ."
"To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day ."
"What happened ?"
"First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work ."
"What did your boss say ?"
"He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !"
"That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?"
"That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident ."
"Is your boss Chinese ?"
"No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things ."
"What are you going to do ?"
"I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss ."
"That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?"
"That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer ."
"Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! "
"So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ?"
"Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us ."
"Did he tell you what she was like first ?"
"Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . "
"I've never met anyone like Clyde before ."
"He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party ."
"Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers ."
"You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” , Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! "
"What book is that ?"
"I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country ."
"Canada , china , and the use are huge too ."
"There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities ."
"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l , Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world ."
"The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . "
"It ’ s going to a volleyball match between the economic department and foreign language department this afternoon . Are any of you keen on volleyball ?"
"Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ?"
"I ’ m afraid not . My favorite is boots-running . I don ’ t care about games . "
"I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great !"
"But they are so silly ! They're not art !"
"That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ?"
"James Cameron , of course ."
"Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ?"
"Well , nobody's perfect ! "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America ."
"We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there ."
"Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ?"
"Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th ."
"Oh , no . It's already February 5th ."
"So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year ."
"I will think about it . "
"How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?"
"No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want ."
"I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot ."
"Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system ."
"I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much ."
"I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains ."
"It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars ."
"Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people ."
"Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change ."
"Why do you say "" have to "" ?"
"Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use ."
"Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important ."
"Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home ."
"Do you want me to give you a ride ?"
"No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner ."
"Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you ."
"See you around . "
"I'll help you with your homework ."
"I appreciate that . "
"Herman , why are you so excited ?"
"I have met a beautiful girl ."
"Have you fallen in love ?"
"Yes . At first sight ."
"Can you describe the situation at that time ?"
"At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold ."
"What's her outlook ?"
"She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . "
"Where is Tom ?"
"He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep ."
"What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?"
"He ran four miles and came back dead beat ."
"Oh , I see . "
"What college are you attending ?"
"I am in Nanjing University . I am a junior ."
"Why did you choose to attend that college ?"
"Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing ."
"What kind of college is it ?"
"Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies .. "
"Which team has won ?"
"Neither . The game ended in two all ."
"But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized ."
"But the Brazilian is tougher . "
"I am really tired of Terry ."
"Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents ."
"He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . "
"What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation !"
"I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math ."
"Why ?"
"I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare ."
"Do you think it will help ?"
"It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record ."
"Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too ."
"I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow . "
"Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ?"
"Oh , yes . You ?"
"Yes . What did you think of it ?"
"I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ?"
"I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant ."
"Mmm . That's what I thought , too . And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins ."
"Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ?"
"Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that ."
"Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . "
"Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ?"
"She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work ."
"Poor girl ! "
"Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?"
"No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend ."
"Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go ."
"They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood ."
"They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want ."
"I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars ."
"Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?"
"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything ."
"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?"
"Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous ."
"I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves ."
"People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated ."
"I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you ."
"That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go ."
"Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !"
"Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . "
"What do you like to do in your spare time ?"
"I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos ."
"What kind of dance do you like ?"
"I like rumba and tango ."
"Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me ."
"You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier ."
"OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?"
"Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ?"
"I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn ."
"Sounds pleasant . "
"I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ?"
"Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight ."
"Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ?"
"Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint ."
"So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ?"
"Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . "
"I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket ."
"Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson ."
"But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him ."
"Then he is really lucky . "
"Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ?"
"I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week ."
"Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... , It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... "
"I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ?"
"Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious ."
"Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it ."
"Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions ."
"Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ?"
"Sure , more elegant and taller ."
"I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color ."
"If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you ."
"Thank you . "
"who is your favorite NBA star ?"
"Kobe Bryant , of course ."
"Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense ."
"He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand ."
"Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ?"
"indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit ."
"Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?"
"who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him ."
"well then , what are your spoils ?"
"well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . "
"Good news !"
"What is it ?"
"The state of economy is starting to go up in our country ."
"That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . "
"The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ?"
"Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year ."
"Are you sure you can do well this year ?"
"I am 100 % certain ."
"According to what you did last time , I have my doubts ."
"I am sure I can get a 95 this time . "
"He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans ."
"I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words ."
"Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person ."
"It seems that you don't like him ."
"You like to communicate with him ? "
"Does bullfight interest you much ?"
"Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on ."
"So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you ."
"What is it ? "
"I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here ."
"I trust you ’ re keeping well ?"
"I ’ m doing great , thank you ."
"So we can get down to business . "
"Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ?"
"Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired ."
"It's probably jet lag ."
"I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired ."
"Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?"
"Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace ."
"Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . "
"You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy ."
"It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week ."
"Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy ."
"Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ?"
"Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially "" Terminator . "" , Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?"
"Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . "
"I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car ."
"Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics ."
"Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics ."
"That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ?"
"No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' ."
"Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ?"
"The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece ."
"Good . Why do people name it Olympics ?"
"They name it after the place where it was first held ."
"Who started the modern Olympics ?"
"This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin ."
"What did people call him ?"
"Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' ."
"What did he do for restoring the Olympics ?"
"He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' ."
"Well , that's for all . Excellent !"
"I've told you I'm an expert . "
"May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ?"
"Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester ."
"I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class ."
"I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class ."
"Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages ."
"Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses ."
"Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses ."
"But isn't it too impolite to be absent ?"
"What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government ."
"Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note ."
"Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record ."
"Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious ."
"I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government ."
"You can't write with one hand and draw with the other ."
"I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note ."
"You can count on me . "
"Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?"
"How regular ?"
"An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that ."
"You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights ."
"But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days ."
"That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . "
"Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind ' ."
"Sorry , we have sold out the tickets ."
"What's on tomorrow at that time ?"
"' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again . And there's also ' Titanic ' ."
"Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ?"
"Yes , 20 yuan for each ."
"Two tickets , please ."
"OK . Here you are . "
"My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race ."
"Excuse me , what did you say ?"
"A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games ."
"That's incredible . I can't believe it ."
"You have to . It is sure ."
"How amazing ! "
"I like small towns ."
"But many roads are very narrow ."
"Not always , and there're also few cars !"
"Yes , because of fewer people . "
"Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ?"
"Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on !"
"I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you ."
"Steven , I ... , I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government ."
"What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ?"
"When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau ."
"What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me !"
"I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real ."
"I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car !"
"Veronica , wait ! "
"Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ?"
"Sure . What's playing ?"
"Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ?"
"Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress ."
"Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas ."
"She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting ."
"What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities ."
"Who is the director ?"
"Steven Spielberg . Another superstar ."
"Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 ."
"Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ?"
"It tells a romantic and humorous love story ."
"This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . "
"What musical instrument do you play ?"
"I can play the piano a bit ."
"Then we can have one more program at our party ?"
"No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . "
"Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ?"
"Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough ."
"Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold ."
"Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all ."
"Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking ."
"Yes , I think you ’ re right ! "
"Hi , Fanny ."
"Hi , Andy ."
"Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning ."
"I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night ."
"What happened ?"
"I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood ."
"Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ?"
"My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help ."
"You have got a great mother ."
"I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk ."
"That sounds good !"
"Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan ."
"Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . "
"Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?"
"Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?"
"Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?"
"Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender ."
"Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !"
"Yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset ."
"That ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?"
"Of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world ."
"You mean you got working experience , right ?"
"Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life ."
"It must be very demanding ."
"Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out ."
"Really ? It sounds interesting ."
"Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around ."
"Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . "
"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?"
"What ? Why do we have to do that ?"
"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour ."
"I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !"
"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !"
"That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! "
"what do you think of studying abroad ?"
"I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ?"
"yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now ."
"which country do you want to go to ?"
"I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive ."
"have you applied to any schools there ?"
"yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago ."
"congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ?"
"I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ?"
"if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ?"
"I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University ."
"if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future ."
"I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make ."
"if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . "
"You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window ."
"Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . "
"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ?"
"I enjoy camping ."
"Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ?"
"I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think ."
"Do you hike or fish on your trips ?"
"Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles ."
"Did you catch anything ?"
"Yes , but I threw them back ."
"How about Joining our summer camp next week ?"
"Great ! I can't wait . "
"Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work ."
"Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too ."
"One less car on the road means less pollution ."
"Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too ."
"How far is it ?"
"Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour ."
"That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train ."
"You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too ."
"True . Well , see you tomorrow ."
"See you . "
"Yeah . You don't need to rub it in ."
"And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... , Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ?"
"That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her ."
"Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now ."
"You really should have stayed with us , Dave . "
"I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ?"
"Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us ."
"I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock ."
"Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann ."
"Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . "
"Hi , John . What brings you to town ?"
"Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party ."
"What do you think of the traffic today ?"
"It ’ s pretty bad ."
"Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too ."
"I am glad I did not drive a car . "
"Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ?"
"Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows ."
"Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me ."
"It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it ."
"Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions ."
"Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch ."
"She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !"
"She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . "
"Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ?"
"Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ?"
"Yes ."
"These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's "" card catalog "" . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM ."
"So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' ."
"No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth ."
"What if I don't know the title of the book ?"
"Well , you can look under the author's name ."
"Could you give me an example ?"
"Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . "
"Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman ."
"It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other ."
"You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle !"
"Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan ."
"It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week ."
"I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . "
"Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ?"
"No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ?"
"I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ?"
"He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions ."
"A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . "
"Hi , how is it going ?"
"Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know ."
"That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here ."
"Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . "
"Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best ."
"Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport ."
"Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise ."
"I will think about it ."
"Come on ! It is really a fun game . "
"We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ?"
"Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race ."
"Really ? I think you ’ ll love it ."
"As long as I don ’ t have to row . "
"Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ?"
"Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ?"
"Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ?"
"I didn ’ t think much of it . Are you ?"
"Sure . Would you like go with me ?"
"Sounds like fun ."
"You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though ."
"Are you broke again ? Let me treat you ."
"Wow ! When did you come into so much cash ?"
"You know , I am a waitress at the student center . Anyway now those final exams are almost over . I ’ d love a night out . "
"not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it !"
"can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing ."
"yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy ."
"actually , this is a kind of addiction called "" infomania "" or "" information overload "" ."
"addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !"
"yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ?"
"absolutely ."
"do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?"
"yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages ."
"do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?"
"yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives ."
"now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . "
"Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning ."
"I ’ Ve been playing computer games ."
"What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ?"
"It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world ."
"You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !"
"My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me ."
"Fine !"
"Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat ."
"Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! "
"Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest ."
"Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ?"
"Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now ."
"Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . "
"You had better get a grab instead of getting upset about little things ."
"I know . But my life seems super stressful . I really don ’ t know how to get a better grab on things ."
"I think as long as you try your best and don ’ t think of anything too much , everything will be all right . "
"Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?"
"I heard it might rain ."
"Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills ."
"Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead ."
"Yes that might be a better idea ."
"Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too ."
"Ok - let ’ s do that then ! "
"On balance , dress designing appeals to me most ."
"Yes , it's to my liking , too ."
"Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?"
"It's my dream . "
"How often do you use the internet ?"
"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor ."
"So , you ’ re online eight hours a day ."
"Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online ."
"How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?"
"I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it ."
"How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?"
"What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . "
"Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world ."
"Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web ."
"One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores ."
"Can you tell me how it is done ?"
"If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge ."
"I see . So great . "
"My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas ."
"If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course ."
"You mean I should please her by following her suggestion ."
"Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . "
"Get changed !"
"What for ? "
"Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !"
"This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming !"
"That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it !"
"What was that ?"
"Relax , it was just a goat !"
"And that ?"
"It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later ."
"What was that ?"
"Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax !"
"Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable ."
"You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! "
"What do you base our grades on ?"
"All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester ."
"Does the final count the most ?"
"All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times ."
"How do you total our scores ?"
"The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest ."
"What if we are out sick ?"
"Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence ."
"How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ?"
"Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on . "
"I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features ."
"Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed ."
"Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them ."
"Is that type of plant found in this country ?"
"No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action ."
"So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ?"
"They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle , That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too ."
"That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species ."
"I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions ."
"According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation ."
"That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . "
"I got the job you recommended me for last week ."
"That's great ! Congratulations ."
"I really don't know how I can thank you enough ."
"Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position ."
"Thank you very much indeed.You helped me rebuild my self-confidence ."
"Don't mention it.You ' re always been good.What do you say we go out to celebrate ?"
"That would be great . "
"The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors ."
"It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it ."
"Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon ."
"That's true . "
"I can ’ t believe it !"
"What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal ."
"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !"
"Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then ."
"I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure ."
"What were the odds ?"
"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !"
"Too bad . "
"Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight !"
"Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory ."
"Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ?"
"My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . "
"What do you think of your teacher ?"
"He's very strict with us ."
"And I hear he gives very good lectures ."
"Indeed.He ' s strict with himself too . "
"Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus ."
"I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ?"
"That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs ."
"Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , "" Ice Ice Baby , "" but I don't know his other songs ."
"That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . "
"what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ?"
"I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?"
"I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv ."
"I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence ."
"yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !"
"right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes ."
"in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour ."
"that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?"
"no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?"
"not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo , some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes ."
"well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? "
"Bon voyage !"
"Goodbye . "
"Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?"
"Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter ."
"Why ?"
"Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard ."
"What for ?"
"So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends ."
"That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?"
"You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?"
"Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle ."
"Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want ."
"Please go ahead , I am listening ."
"I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door ."
"Is your back door higher than the ground level ?"
"Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground ."
"Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail ."
"I don't like things to be fancy ."
"Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look ."
"Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?"
"Cedar is a good choice ."
"Well , let's take the measurements right now . "
"Joan is a thorough drag !"
"What is it ?"
"She keeps talking when I'm reading ."
"There must be something wrong with her . "
"The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ?"
"Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image ."
"That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent ."
"I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president ."
"But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . "
"What courses are you taking ?"
"Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on ."
"What do you think about the teachers ?"
"To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring !"
"That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ?"
"Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California ."
"What is he like ?"
"He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing ."
"Are you able to follow him ?"
"Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly ."
"Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher ."
"Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . "
"How do I apply to an American university ?"
"You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one ."
"I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply ."
"That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars ."
"What's to come next ?"
"If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing ."
"How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?"
"From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well ."
"Thank you . I appreciate your help ."
"You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . "
"Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ?"
"Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?"
"First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story ."
"That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case ."
"How do you research your books ?"
"I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact , I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !"
"Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go ."
"Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?"
"There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your , Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . "
"What do you do in your spare time ?"
"During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips ."
"That sounds interesting ."
"Yes , it helps me to relax ."
"Do you have any hobbies ?"
"I like to paint .  , What kind of things do you paint ?"
"Mainly seascapes ."
"What kinds of sports do you like ?"
"I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . I was in the climbing club all through school . "
"Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time ."
"Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ?"
"Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ?"
"Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom ."
"Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? "
"How's your time spent in the United States ?"
"Well , pretty good ."
"I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ?"
"Well , the cultural differences impressed me most ."
"You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?"
"That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question ."
"That's weird ."
"And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible ."
"You really cared about your friend ."
"Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' ."
"I'm confused . Why did he say that ?"
"I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind ."
"Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . "
"It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system ."
"That's pretty advanced ."
"Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement ."
"Is that where you park ?"
"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in ."
"Thank you . Where is your key ?"
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home ."
"That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment ."
"Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out ."
"Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves ."
"Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?"
"Here it is , and here we are ."
"When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level ."
"I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . "
"Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting ."
"OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together ."
"So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day ."
"You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape ."
"Is it official ?"
"It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . "
"Have you heard that we will have reorganization ?"
"No , really ?"
"Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department ."
"Who will be there ?"
"James is going to be packed off there ."
"That is good . He can leave you alone this time . "
"Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children ."
"They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering ."
"That ’ s human nature . "
"Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ?"
"Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat ."
"Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied ."
"Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment ."
"Okay ... , I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go ."
"What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ?"
"I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee !"
"What ! I resent that !"
"Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! "
"How did Jim get the money ?"
"He borrowed it from Nick ."
"He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark ."
"He was too desperate to find some other way . "
"Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore ."
"But it was her that makes us so embarrassed ."
"I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?"
"I don't care . "
"My goodness ! You ’ re kidding !"
"No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job ."
"That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ?"
"It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities ."
"Come on ! Don ’ t be silly !"
"Your present job is something better . Why do you change ?"
"Well . How do you know ? "
"But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out ."
"Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men ."
"I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too ."
"That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . "
"That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful ."
"Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras ."
"I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price ."
"Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions ."
"Such as ?"
"They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode ."
"They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand ."
"Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital ."
"What does this mean ?"
"This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer ."
"I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing ."
"Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects ."
"What special effects ?"
"Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves ."
"That's great !"
"With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners ."
"So everybody's getting video mail . "
"Hi , David ! What are you doing ?"
"Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ?"
"Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... , Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club ."
"Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in ."
"Well ... What are you interested in ?"
"How about the Classical Music Club ?"
"Joanna , give me a break ."
"Hey-how about the Cinema Club ?"
"Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! "
"Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime ."
"And it's all coming down to the next three weeks ."
"The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina ."
"Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ?"
"Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . "
"So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?"
"Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore ."
"That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather ."
"What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ?"
"It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?"
"My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . "
"May I help you ?"
"I would like to return this book ."
"May I do anything else for you ?"
"I would also like to check out this magazine ."
"I can ’ t let you do that ."
"Why is that ?"
"Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines ."
"What things am I allowed to check out ?"
"You are only allowed to check out books or videos ."
"I really need to check out this magazine ."
"I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy ."
"That ’ s stupid . "
"Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ?"
"You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ?"
"Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat ."
"Great , I like the idea of trying some new food ."
"Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world ."
"Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . "
"Steve . Is that you ?"
"Yeah . What's going on ?"
"Not much . What a surprise to see you here ."
"Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you ."
"What have you been up to ?"
"I just started working out ."
"Really ? Where do you work out at ?"
"I joined the Samsung Health Club last month ."
"What do you mostly do during your workout ?"
"I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach ."
"I should start exercising more ."
"It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done ."
"I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it ."
"Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising ."
"If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym ."
"I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ?"
"That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend ."
"Great . I'll call you Saturday morning ."
"Aright . I'll talk to you later ."
"Ok . Bye . "
"Anything interesting in this city ?"
"We have a beautiful natural park ."
"It's worth the time ."
"Come on.Let ' s walk there . "
"Is there anything wrong ?"
"I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college ."
"Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager ."
"I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything ."
"You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision ."
"But I just want to give her some tips ."
"Oh , she can make her own decisions . "
"You didn't tell me she was married !"
"I tried . You were preoccupied ."
"I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me !"
"You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up ."
"That guy was definitely a Don ."
"So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha ."
"Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... , Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . "
"Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood ."
"Hackneyed theme !"
"What ? How much do you know Hollywood ?"
"Nearly everything ."
"You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ?"
"Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often ."
"Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s , Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it ."
"Mm . What came after that ?"
"After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals ."
"Pretty good . Please continue ."
"Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . ."
"The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers ."
"Come on ."
"Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have ."
"Any more ?"
"Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . "
"How good are you at sports , Bill ?"
"Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week ."
"Wow !"
"Do you like sports , Janice ?"
"Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things ."
"Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ?"
"Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward ."
"That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before ."
"Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding ."
"Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . "
"Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house ."
"I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself !"
"That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent ."
"It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own ."
"They see their independence as a kind of character strength ."
"Sometimes they are too independent . "
"Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ?"
"No , nobody ."
"You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ?"
"Well , to be frank , yes , I do ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ?"
"Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign ."
"Sign ? What ’ s sign ?"
"There , on the window ."
"Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry ."
"That ’ s all right . "
"And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant !"
"Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover ."
"OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ?"
"Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines ."
"So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ?"
"I guess I'm lending them to you ... "
"I've moved ."
"Where to ? "
"Do you know who that tall man is ?"
"I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot ."
"Why ?"
"Because everyone is trying to butter him up . "
"Did you go to see Michael last night ?"
"Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle ."
"Did he let you ride it ?"
"Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it ."
"Weren ’ t you frightened ?"
"Sure . But I still liked it ."
"Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ?"
"No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle ."
"But why ? Since you like it so much ."
"Because bicycles are safer . "
"I passed history test ."
"Really ? That ’ s marvelous !"
"And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time ."
"I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . "
"Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ?"
"It's an excellent one . I like it very much ."
"Why ?"
"It includes a lot of useful words and phrases ."
"I agree with you . "
"Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me !"
"What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack ."
"Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son !"
"Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like ."
"That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people ."
"That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !"
"Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky ."
"Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod ."
"Now that ’ s a great idea ! "
"Do you do morning exercises ?"
"Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up ."
"Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ?"
"Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . "
"He loves that blonde girl ."
"Yes , he once gave her seven roses ."
"Did she accept it ?"
"No way to know . "
"Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ?"
"How about Great Canyon ?"
"Is it worth seeing ?"
"Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . "
"I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg ."
"Are they coming to Chicago again ?"
"Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August ."
"Oh , good ! We can all get together again ."
"I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game ."
"And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park ."
"Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?"
"Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs ."
"I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . "
"Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ?"
"Sure , I have . Will you join ?"
"I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere ."
"You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking ."
"I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there ."
"No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that ."
"Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . "
"My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold ."
"You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you ."
"Not often . Just when I make mistakes . "
"Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China ."
"It it true of many countries ."
"You know why ?"
"Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . "
"What book is that ?"
"I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country ."
"Canada , China , and the USA are huge too ."
"There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities ."
"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all ."
"Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world ."
"The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . "
"So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ?"
"Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite ."
"You know what comedy I really like ? "" Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . "" I think Jim Carry is really funny ."
"Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever ."
"I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is "" Titanic . "" "
"How about a movie tonight ?"
"It doesn ’ t matter to me ."
"Does 7 o'clock suit you ?"
"Either way . I don ’ t care ."
"How about a snack after work ?"
"I couldn ’ t careless ."
"Would you rather stay home ?"
"Whatever you say ."
"Are you really interested in doing something ?"
"I don ’ t mind if you want to . "
"I think he won't remember White Day ."
"Silly , you should make sure he does ."
"Uh-huh . How about you ?"
"He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant ."
"You got a big return for a small gift . "
"You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married !"
"Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple !"
"I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night ."
"You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party ."
"Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top ."
"Well , I don ’ t know ."
"Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !"
"Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party !"
"What ! "
"Hi , what ’ re you reading ?"
"Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ?"
"No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ?"
"Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries ."
"Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . "
"It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves ."
"How many different varieties of products do you import from China ?"
"China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports ."
"Do you import any food items ?"
"Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . "
"We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?"
"No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?"
"What about a factory tour ?"
"You mean visit a factory ?"
"Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry ."
"Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?"
"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour ."
"Really ? What do the companies do that for ?"
"I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known ."
"Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors ."
"Exactly ."
"Do we need an appointment beforehand ?"
"I'll call the tourist information centre to check . "
"Are you still on your summer vacation ?"
"Yes ."
"When will school start ?"
"It'll start on lst September . "
"Good evening , Mr . Wu ."
"Good evening , Mr . Smith ."
"Have you met my wife , Mary ?"
"No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure ."
"Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend ."
"How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome ."
"How do you do ?"
"Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests . "
"This is my house.Let me show you around it ."
"How beautiful the detached house is !"
"Follow me to the back-yard ."
"It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers ."
"We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning ."
"No wonder it smells fragrant ."
"Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later ."
"It's fantastic ! "
"You mean it shuts off to save energy ?"
"Yep . And it breathes , see !"
"It's not breathing !"
"Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on ."
"Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly ."
"I would look so cool carrying this around !"
"And you'd look so cool ! "
"Some people are easily flimflammed ."
"Maybe they are still wet behind ears ."
"They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course ."
"Sure . Many people , including men and women , and be easily ripped off . "
"Okay , let's begin . Hello , everyone . My name's Karl Roberts , and I'll be your teacher for this class , Intercultural Communication ."
"( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying ."
"Uh , to begin with , please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 ."
"That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning ?"
"Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation ."
"I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not . "
"Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning ."
"I know them . They are the two brothers living next door ."
"Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ?"
"It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers ."
"Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?"
"No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . "
"Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?"
"Yes , is that you , Allen ?"
"Yes , how are you doing ?"
"Not bad ."
"Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?"
"Sure.Thank you very much ."
"Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?"
"Ok , see you ."
"See you . "
"David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ?"
"It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched ."
"I am so nervous now . What a terrific game !"
"Which side are you on ?"
"It's hard to say , because each team has my idols ."
"Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know ."
"I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct ."
"What a good goal ! "
"Can you recommend a resort to me ?"
"What about the Yellowstone National Park ?"
"Have you ever been there ?"
"Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking ."
"What is especially impressive ?"
"There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them ."
"Is there a waterfall ?"
"Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon ."
"What an attractive place ! How can I get there ?"
"You can take No . 2 bus . "
"Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you !"
"What is that ?"
"A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play !"
"Cool !"
"Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally ."
"What about all these other pieces ?"
"See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it ."
"And these two ? They are husband and wife ?"
"That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?"
"Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! "
"All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull ."
"Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls ."
"Then why are you wearing black shoes ?"
"Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go ."
"Hey , thanks , mum . "
"I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike ."
"Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it ."
"I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . "
"He got the scholarship to Harvard ."
"You're kidding !"
"It's true . He is a hard worker ."
"I know he really deserves this . "
"Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ?"
"OK . Shall we go to a bar ?"
"Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night ."
"Why ?"
"For killing time and making new friends ."
"Don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it ."
"Calm down ! My little guy ! You'll get used to that after you come here several times ."
"Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me ."
"I'd like a gin and tonic . "
"What ?"
"What happened with that guy at the cafe ?"
"nothing ."
"But you ’ re crazy about him ."
"Yes , I am ."
"Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?"
"I don ’ t actually know him ."
"Really ?"
"I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this ."
"Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ?"
"Yes ."
"Hmm . ' You ’ Ve got mail . ' "
"I don't stand a chance of passing the exam ."
"Come on , Brenda ! Never say die . "
"Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ?"
"OK . When ?"
"At 10 o'clock ."
"10 in the morning ?"
"No , at night ."
"Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM ."
"OK , how about 1:30 PM ?"
"No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then ."
"How about 5:00 PM ?"
"That's fine ."
"OK , see you then ."
"Alright . Bye . "
"Have you been to Shanghai before ?"
"Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year ."
"That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ?"
"No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do ."
"So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ?"
"Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! "
"Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ?"
"Oh , yes . I really like it here ."
"Would you like to do something tonight ?"
"Sure . I'd love to ."
"Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ?"
"Yes . I've already been to several clubs here ."
"OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ?"
"Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week ."
"So , what do you want to do ?"
"Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time ."
"Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater ."
"Great ! Let's make a reservation . "
"Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ?"
"The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products ."
"I see ."
"If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me ."
"OK , I will . "
"How are you , Sue ?"
"Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published ."
"Congratulations on your success ."
"Thank you ."
"And how ’ s your brother ?"
"He is fine ."
"He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?"
"Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa ."
"Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations ."
"Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . "
"How long have you been in Taiwan ?"
"About 3 years , so I came here 2000 ."
"So , where did you grow up ?"
"Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ?"
"I am not sure , where exactly is it ?"
"Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ?"
"No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . "
"What are you doing ?"
"Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty ."
"Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful !"
"Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?"
"I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural ."
"Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well ."
"I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing ."
"I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive ."
"You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts !"
"Really ?"
"Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! "
"I just won the lottery ."
"You're kidding ! "
"Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring !"
"I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . "
"How good are you at sports , Bill ?"
"Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week ."
"Wow !"
"Do you like sports , Janice ?"
"Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things ."
"Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ?"
"Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward ."
"That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before ."
"Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding ."
"Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . "
"I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows ."
"I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . "
"My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old ."
"The early bird catches the worm . "
"What do you know about Julia Roberts ?"
"Her acting is OK ."
"I mean her personality ."
"I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? "
"Your knowledge of English is really surprising ."
"Oh , it's nothing to speak of ."
"No , seriously . I'm impressed ."
"Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . "
"Your search on this project has been excellent ."
"Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team ."
"The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client ."
"Well , I hope the client feels the same way !"
"I am sure they will be pleased . "
"Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here ."
"Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze ."
"All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ?"
"Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . "
"More and more women don ’ t want to stay at home and keep house now ."
"This is the result of women ’ s liberation ."
"Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ?"
"I have no idea . "
"What are you doing this weekend ?"
"Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned ."
"So you ’ re free on Saturday night ?"
"That ’ s right ."
"Would you like to have dinner with me ?"
"Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ?"
"Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then . "
"And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time ."
"Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today ."
"Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job ."
"No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement ."
"Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint ."
"And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions ."
"Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points ."
"Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . "
"What are you listening now , Fred ?"
"What ?"
"Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to ."
"Jay Chou's title song in his new album ."
"What's your comment on his new album ?"
"Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile ."
"Let me enjoy it ."
"I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart ."
"I cann't wait for buying his CD now . "
"Hi , it is a pleasant surprise !"
"Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?"
"Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?"
"Just as usual , you know . "
"You seem really ticked off . What's up ?"
"Just get out of my face , would you ?"
"Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ?"
"Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything !"
"Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher ."
"Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ?"
"She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too ."
"Get out of here !"
"I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ , Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! "
"Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?"
"No , it's the Japanese team ."
"Japanese teams always play a dark horse ."
"Well , their team work is well worth learning . "
"Hi Mary , how's it going ?"
"well , last night I had a big argument with Ann ."
"terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends ."
"now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper ."
"really ? What happened ?"
"it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee , that's pretty harsh ."
"I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?"
"you know she probably feels just as bad ."
"well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often ."
"well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want ."
"yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . "
"OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy ."
"Well , thank you ."
"What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ?"
"Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained ."
"Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot ."
"Do ya ?"
"Yeah , so maybe it's my diet ."
"It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars ."
"That's pretty tough ! "
"What upsets you ?"
"My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date ."
"It is not your mother finding one for you ?"
"I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl ."
"Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type ."
"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea ."
"No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes ."
"I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time ."
"I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight ."
"Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that ."
"Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications ."
"Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher ."
"I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . "
"Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ?"
"Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie ."
"I wonder why TV programs often show much violence ."
"Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers ."
"They are especially harmful to teenagers ."
"But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . "
"I hate to see the abuse of animals ."
"It makes me sick . "
"Can I borrow these magazines ?"
"Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want ."
"Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ?"
"Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . "
"I never watch foreign films . They're too boring ."
"Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie ."
"Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie !"
"I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written ."
"Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob ."
"No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! "
"What did the boss say to you ?"
"He asked me to beef up in the work ."
"Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter ."
"Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . "
"Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ?"
"I don ’ t really mind ."
"We can go to that new Chinese restaurant ."
"I suppose I could ."
"Come on , let ’ s try it ."
"All right . If you really want to . "
"There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms ."
"What are those ?"
"They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons ."
"Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ?"
"Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can ."
"I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . "
"Who is it ?"
"Supervisor . Open the door ."
"Wait a sec ."
"What are you doing here ?"
"We're watching a football match . What's the matter ?"
"Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep ."
"I'm sorry about this ."
"Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration ."
"You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . "
"So Kevin , what is your type ?"
"I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious ."
"I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh ."
"That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . "
"I can ’ t decide what to do today ."
"Well . Let ’ s go swimming ."
"Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ?"
"Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . "
"Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship ."
"Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events ."
"Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ?"
"We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters ."
"That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win ."
"The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds ."
"That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ?"
"A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place ."
"Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts ."
"Was he disqualified ?"
"Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . "
"Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !"
"Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that ."
"No , we just don ’ t usually admit it !"
"Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! "
"Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ?"
"Yes , certainly.How can I help you ?"
"Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ?"
"Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. , Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ?"
"Certainly not.Here it is ."
"Thanks a lot "
"There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?"
"I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late ."
"We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries , Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a , In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e , It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people ."
"Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment ."
"I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . "
"Going to the cafeteria ?"
"No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ?"
"That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch ."
"Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . "
"I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment ."
"What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?"
"He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment ."
"Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... , You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words ."
"That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . "
"Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ?"
"Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself ."
"And , her lips ?"
"Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy ."
"And her voice like a lark's song ?"
"Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song ."
"Oh , she sings too ?"
"Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . "
"Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?"
"Sorry , I have to work overtime ."
"You are really career minded ."
"My boss promised to pay me double time . "
"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose ."
"Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?"
"Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there ."
"Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !"
"What other activities will you have tomorrow ?"
"Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second ."
"Do you bring some gifts along ?"
"That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand ."
"Is it the same practice for all families ?"
"Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday ."
"I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax ."
"Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . "
"You seem to be very hesitant about doing things ."
"I don't know why I cannot take a step forward ."
"You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess ."
"Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go ."
"That's where the shoe pinches . "
"Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money ."
"Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?"
"Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg ."
"I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate ."
"But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity ."
"Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point ."
"Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
"What do you think of smoking ?"
"It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others ."
"What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?"
"Stop producing cigarettes ."
"But that ’ ll affect the national economy ."
"That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways ."
"How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?"
"Maybe it can take effect . "
"do you like playing games ?"
"I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games ."
"how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ?"
"the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned !"
"if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it ."
"how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ?"
"I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions !"
"I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !"
"hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube ."
"it's a deal ."
"do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ?"
"yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ?"
"I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party !"
"I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo ."
"if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it ."
"let's get started with this game then ."
"ok . "
"I have a bone to pick with you ."
"Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ?"
"You always have a chip on your shoulder ."
"I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . "
"OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ?"
"The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola ."
"Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff !"
"Only about old movies , really ... "
"It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control ."
"It ’ s a typical of them to do so ."
"What can we do ?"
"We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . "
"This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives ."
"That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?"
"3000 RIB as bonus for each person ."
"To encourage the staff increases ."
"Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch ."
"What about the afternoon ?"
"At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . "
"How do you get along with your co-workers ?"
"I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip ."
"Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ?"
"It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts ."
"So how do you develop good relationships in the office ?"
"I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with ."
"I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . "
"So how did you meet Bill ?"
"I met him through a computer bulletin board ."
"Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ?"
"It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 ."
"I've heard about that , but I've never tried it ."
"You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network ."
"I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers ."
"That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to ."
"I just want a private conversation with one other person ."
"You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them ."
"Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk ."
"That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line ."
"It ’ s that popular ?"
"It sure is . "
"Have a nice weekend !"
"Thanks.You too !"
"Do you have any plans ?"
"Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ?"
"Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . "
"What did you major in ?"
"I major in Chemistry ."
"What is your specialty ?"
"Organic Chemistry is my specialty . "
"Ouch !"
"Are you all right ?"
"Yeah , I just bumped into the table . "
"Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again ."
"Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ?"
"Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ?"
"You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . "
"You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic ."
"Where did you get that idea ?"
"That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other ."
"Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me ."
"Is it true or isn ’ t it ?"
"Do you want to know something about the American character ?"
"I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead ."
"No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age ."
"OK , go on ."
"After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?"
"Not exactly , but I see your point ."
"I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . "
"Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ?"
"Yes ."
"Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch ."
"No problem . What should I bring ?"
"I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . "
"What's your weight ?"
"150 pounds ."
"Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat ."
"I can't bear eating less . "
"Did you ever take History 231 ?"
"Yeah . Last semester ."
"Who was the professor ?"
"It was Professor Johnson ."
"I have him this semester . What do you think about him ?"
"He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader ."
"What did you end up getting ?"
"I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade ."
"That's probably because he grades on a curve ."
"Are you enjoying the class so far ?"
"I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out ."
"Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot ."
"Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . "
"It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters ."
"What do you mean by that ?"
"Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions ."
"You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything ."
"Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?"
"I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting ."
"Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?"
"That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic ."
"I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting ."
"And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend ."
"Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . "
"Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ?"
"Umm ... I think so . What's up ?"
"I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim ."
"Really ? Are you OK ?"
"I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ?"
"If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered ."
"Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ?"
"Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too ."
"That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?"
"Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider ."
"So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?"
"That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . "
"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought ."
"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football ."
"Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?"
"The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone ."
"Wow ! What a hit !"
"Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off ."
"Is he ok ?"
"It looks like it , he ’ s getting up ."
"I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team ."
"The Giants ?"
"Yeah ."
"Well , here we go again ."
"What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?"
"The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . "
"Hi . You enjoying the party ?"
"Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ?"
"Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way ."
"Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ?"
"I'm in finance . You ?"
"Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them ."
"T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ?"
"About two years . And you ? Are you based here ?"
"No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... "
"Are you still working day and night ?"
"Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends . "
"But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet !"
"I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything !"
"That stamp you've been looking for is for sale ."
"The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ?"
"Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . "
"Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together ."
"And what ’ s the problem ?"
"When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual ."
"And you want to know what to wear ?"
"Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know ."
"That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ?"
"Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight ."
"My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . "
"Who got ripped off ?"
"Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ?"
"Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use ."
"Now we're getting to the truth ."
"There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale ."
"See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . "
"How many courses do you have for this semester ?"
"Eight altogether ."
"How are they proportioned ?"
"Six are compulsory , two optional . "
"I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?"
"I don ’ t know . What do you think ?"
"I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn ."
"What do natives get ?"
"They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity ."
"Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?"
"Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken ."
"I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities ."
"Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . "
"Do I need a visa ?"
"No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course ."
"Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency ."
"Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them ."
"Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing ."
"You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine ."
"That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long ."
"Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . "
"What are your weekend arrangements ?"
"There're many things I can do on weekends ."
"What sort of things are you interested in ?"
"I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ?"
"I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours ."
"That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ?"
"Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ?"
"I'm fond of dancing ."
"Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . "
"Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks ."
"He spoke evil behind his back ."
"How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ?"
"Someone told Joe off ."
"He is then in a very difficult situation ."
"Sure . He ’ ll get the bag , I think . "
"I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug ."
"There's no need to apologize ."
"But I ruined your rug ."
"Forget it . It was an accident . "
"Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ?"
"I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend ."
"Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything ."
"But I cannot forget him . "
"We'd like a half-day package ."
"We offer many different sea water treatments ."
"How many can we choose ?"
"The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three ."
"We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage ."
"OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . "
"I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid ."
"That ’ s understandable . Every kid likes new clothes ."
"It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . "
"What did you do last vacation ?"
"I learned to drive and I got a driving license ."
"What will you do this vacation ?"
"Travel . "
"What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ?"
"Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high ."
"So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?"
"No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs ."
"How can a business maximise revenues ?"
"You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small ."
"What else do you suggest ?"
"Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . "
"This paper absorbs water so quickly !"
"Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills . "
"John has some trouble in his life ."
"I hear that his father died ."
"Yeah . He ’ s been having an easy time since he was a boy , and now he doesn ’ t know how to face the music ."
"He is out of luck . "
"Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland ."
"And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup !"
"The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds ."
"That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside ."
"No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick ."
"Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick !"
"This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... "
"Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ?"
"Hello , there , my name is Tonia ."
"Do you sing alto ?"
"Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you ."
"Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone ."
"Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them ."
"I heard them warming up earlier . You're right ."
"It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! "
"So John , have you ever been to China before ?"
"No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China ."
"Have you travelled to many other countries ?"
"To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe ."
"What about America ? Have you ever been to the United States ?"
"Actually , I haven ’ t been to the states but I have been to Canada . "
"What kind of movies do you like , Sue ?"
"I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance ."
"Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ?"
"You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” ."
"Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . "
"I could get along fine without all the office politics ."
"What's going on ?"
"There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking ."
"So what happened ?"
"We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees ."
"So what does that have to do with this position ?"
"Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted ."
"All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . "
"What are you reading ?"
"It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language ."
"It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language ."
"Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan – so beginning again , Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ?"
"The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ?"
"Not yet ."
"So shall we have lunch together ? I ’ d like to take you this time ."
"I ’ d like to , but I can ’ t ."
"How come ?"
"I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule ."
"All right . Can we make it another time ?"
"Sure , thanks ."
"I ’ ll call you later . Bye ."
"Bye . "
"Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off ."
"What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face ."
"Then what shall we do ?"
"Call the police . "
"What do you think about violence in movies ?"
"Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch ."
"But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?"
"If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . "
"Can you help me do an internet search ?"
"Sure . What do you want to find ?"
"I want to find information on World War Two ."
"Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that ."
"Yes , I want to know about the Normandy Landing ."
"Ok . Well , go to www.google.com , and type in Normandy Landing ."
"Oh , wow ! There are lot of sites ."
"Here , try this one . It's a good site about Normandy Landing ."
"Thanks ."
"For detailed information , however , you should read a history book ."
"Thanks . If I am interested , I'll go to the library . "
"I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is ."
"I'm on your side . It needs to be done over . "
"We're lucky today ."
"Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace , Where's Hyde Park ?"
"It's on the other side of the Palace ."
"That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ?"
"Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen ."
"Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there ."
"Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today ."
"Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating . "
"Hi , John , how was your vacation ?"
"Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand ."
"That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?"
"Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia ."
"Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?"
"A little , but the rush was worth it ."
"Tell me about it ."
"We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us ."
"500 feet ! I would never be able to do that ."
"Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . "
"How ’ s the food ?"
"It ’ s pretty good ."
"Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all !"
"I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food ."
"I eat dog food when my parents are out ."
"We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now ."
"Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition !"
"Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change !"
"Good idea ! "
"I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title ."
"I'm not sure I can't agree , dan ."
"Why not ?"
"Surely , there are other ways to save money ."
"What are you talking about , we tried everything ! "
"Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ?"
"Sure.Which one ?"
"Titanic ."
"Where do you want to sit ?"
"Front , please ."
"Are these seats all right ? They're in the second rows ."
"Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ?"
"Sorry.We ' Ve nothing further back ."
"All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ?"
"Thirty yuan ."
"Fairly expensive . "
"Are you excited about your trip next month ?"
"Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified ."
"Why ?"
"Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying ."
"Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia ."
"You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia ."
"I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad ."
"Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak ."
"Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds ."
"We are such weirdos right ? "
"Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?"
"Oh , that sounds great !"
"I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ?"
"Yes , that would be perfect ."
"See you tonight then ."
"Yes . Thank you for inviting me . "
"Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?"
"Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers ."
"Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?"
"Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion ."
"I didn ’ t pay attention to that . "
"Do you know about All Fools ' Day ?"
"On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool ."
"April fool !"
"April the first is coming.Be careful ! "
"Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ?"
"There ’ s a possibility ."
"What do you mean by that ?"
"I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt ."
"Is that so ?"
"Absolutely . Take my word for it . "
"I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert ."
"How about going to the theatre ?"
"I don't like going to the theatre ."
"Well , what do you like doing ?"
"Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ?"
"I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you ."
"I like talking to you , too ."
"Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow ."
"That's a good idea . "
"You want to go to the movies tonight ?"
"Sure ! What ' s playing ?"
"The new Twilight movie !"
"Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense ."
"Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing ."
"I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! "
"Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ?"
"You can never do that ."
"Why ?"
"There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . "
"You look really wiped out ?"
"I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office ."
"Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning ."
"I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . "
"Do you know much about computers ?"
"Not a great deal ."
"I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now ."
"For accounting system and things like that , you mean ?"
"Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris ."
"Yes ?"
"The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets ."
"Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer ."
"That's right . "
"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?"
"Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ?"
"It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day ."
"You forgot all about it , didn't you ? "
"Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ?"
"Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along ."
"How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable ."
"That has nothing to do with it ... , I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... , I do ."
"Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . "
"It smells like an ashtray in here !"
"Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?"
"What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking ."
"No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !"
"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before ."
"I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?"
"Fine ! I want a divorce ! "
"Jack , could you check your calendar ?"
"Sure , what's going on ?"
"We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone ."
"Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . "
"It is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight ."
"Really ?"
"Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out ."
"I will . Thanks for telling me . "
"What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today ."
"I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ?"
"Well , English is a "" paper tiger "" . Its natural enemy is adequate practice ."
"I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words ."
"I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language ."
"Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . "
"The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... , Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you ."
"Sure . 7 is B . Any others ?"
"No , thank you . "
"Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome ."
"Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball ."
"Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . "
"I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ?"
"Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley ."
"I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty ."
"Thank you so much . You're an expert . "
"Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well ."
"Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand ."
"Nice ! So , where did you guys go ?"
"We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !"
"Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !"
"Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar !"
"Is that why you missed work today ?"
"Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times ."
"Www !"
"I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again !"
"Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go ."
"Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! "
"Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ?"
"I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work ."
"Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition ."
"It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ?"
"You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful ."
"Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !"
"But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body ."
"So a deadline will cause that same reaction ?"
"It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !"
"So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? "
"When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?"
"I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?"
"I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill ."
"That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant ."
"That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?"
"Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill ."
"Did you ? How is he these days ?"
"He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other ."
"I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ?"
"Of course . What do you want to move first ?"
"Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . "
"Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus !"
"Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world ."
"Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures ."
"Those clothes do suit him better ."
"Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ?"
"Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? "
"Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ?"
"Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world ."
"You are very lucky . "
"I need some flowers for my girlfriend ."
"No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?"
"Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion ."
"How much did you want to spend ?"
"Money is no object ."
"Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily ."
"I will take ten ."
"Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now ."
"Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?"
"Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge ."
"That's ok . Here is the address . "
"Julie , what's on the tube ?"
"nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing ."
"yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on ."
"okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain ."
"it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing ."
"alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it ."
"oh , what is it ?"
"it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy ."
"oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside ."
"yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch ."
"I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real ."
"cool . "
"That woman is a thorough drag !"
"What is it ?"
"She keeps spitting on the ground ."
"Maybe there's something wrong with her . "
"To be a revolutionary needs great courage !"
"He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities ."
"Galileo is one of them ."
"So are Copernicus and many others . "
"Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come ."
"That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ?"
"Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day ."
"So will I . Thank you . "
"David , I heard you lost your job ."
"Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me ."
"Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . "
"You look very professional in the suit ."
"The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable ."
"I appreciate it . It is related to company image . "
"Did you tip the bellboy ?"
"Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars ."
"That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more ."
"It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much !"
"I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service ."
"I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ?"
"Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . "
"William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ?"
"He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well ."
"It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ?"
"I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on ."
"Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . "
"Do you like to dance ?"
"Sometimes , if there's music playing ."
"What kind of dancing do you like ?"
"It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . "
"Mom , what are you doing ?"
"I'm clipping coupons ."
"Still clipping coupons ?"
"It's a good way to save money ."
"Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ?"
"How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . "
"Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate ."
"Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival ."
"Yes , it deserves its name ."
"Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?"
"Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?"
"They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival ."
"It's interesting and I want to buy one home . "
"Do you have s second ?"
"Sure . What do you want ?"
"I want to tell you I've put in my notice ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays ."
"And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?"
"Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair ."
"Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade ."
"That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . "
"Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ?"
"Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up ."
"You are kidding , but she's so helpful ."
"Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you ."
"Come on . She's like that with everyone ."
"I don't think so actually . She never even says "" hello "" to me . "
"What a boring film !"
"The acting of the heroine is too artificial ."
"And the plot is so simple . "
"So , John , what do you do for a living ?"
"I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company ."
"Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?"
"Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that ."
"Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ?"
"About two years now . "
"Are you planning on studying abroad ?"
"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . "
"Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ?"
"Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters ."
"Is uncle Bill your brother ?"
"No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother ."
"So his two daughters are my cousins ?"
"That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters ."
"What are step-sisters ?"
"Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again ."
"So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ?"
"Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother ."
"And when are they coming to visit us ?"
"They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . "
"I think he deserved his gold ."
"Did you see his last dive ."
"Yes , it's perfect !"
"He's diving for the gold . "
"Are you interested in history ?"
"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks ."
"I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened ."
"I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !"
"Some people say that history repeats itself ."
"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?"
"The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same ."
"I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . "
"I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ?"
"So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good ."
"What part of the film do you like best ?"
"Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most ."
"I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears ."
"Actually , tears also came to my eyes ."
"It has got this year's Oscar Award ."
"It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . "
"I just got a letter from an old high school buddy ."
"Really ? That's nice ."
"He usually keeps me posted ."
"I've been completely out of touch with my old friends ."
"It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much ."
"Yes , people just seem to drift apart . "
"I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else ."
"They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness ."
"But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . "
"What are you using for bait today ?"
"We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them ."
"Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too ."
"Looks like a lucky day for everyone . "
"Do you know something about Mount Tai ?"
"Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China ."
"Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ?"
"Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation ."
"Got it . Can we see any things left by them ?"
"Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain ."
"I want to see them . How can I go there ?"
"That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . "
"Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study ."
"Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages ."
"What do your classmates think of it ?"
"They give me a lot of congratulations ."
"How long will you study there ."
"Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back ."
"Which university will you go to ?"
"Chicago University . My major is Economics ."
"Good luck !"
"Thank you ! "
"Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday ."
"This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it ."
"Why ? Do you know that guy ?"
"No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars ."
"That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks ."
"No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything ."
"Wow . That's wonderful ."
"What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?"
"Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . "
"have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?"
"yeah , almost . But there is one thing ."
"what ?"
"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... , what is it ?"
"some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others ."
"that makes you feel uncomfortable ?"
"yeah . we never do that in a public office ."
"perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy ."
"i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding ."
"well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus ."
"just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?"
"yeah ."
"Oh , I'm shocked . "
"what's your apartment like ?"
"it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus ."
"what is it like living in on-campus housing ?"
"it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it ."
"did you have to pay a deposit ?"
"no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month ."
"do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?"
"no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here ."
"how long is your contract for ?"
"that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon ."
"have you started looking again yet ?"
"not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer ."
"Good luck ! "
"You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights ."
"Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights ."
"Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings ."
"I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala ."
"You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching ."
"Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products ."
"As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . "
"Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear ."
"Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things ."
"Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation ."
"So decode this for me , Madame Psycho ."
"That's Madame Psychic to you ."
"I'm waiting ... , Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! "
"Mary , how was your date with john ?"
"it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common ."
"oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?"
"he is tall and slim , fair-haired ."
"sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?"
"he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . "
"Did you go to the concert last weekend ?"
"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?"
"Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist ."
"How much was the ticket ?"
"I only paid two dollars for mine . "
"Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ?"
"It leaves in 20 minutes ."
"Good ."
"Can you pick me up from the airport ? "
"It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening ."
"Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time ."
"OK . "
"Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ?"
"Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues ."
"Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work ."
"That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off ."
"You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"how was your education going on in Australia ?"
"I'm going to graduate this summer ."
"where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ?"
"I'm planning to return to China after graduation ."
"why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad ."
"well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment ."
"yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country ."
"absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business ."
"the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home ."
"that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China . "
"How do you like this dress ?"
"It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?"
"Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ?"
"Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year ."
"People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve ."
"Any other common customs of your New Year ?"
"Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution ."
"What's that ?"
"It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days !"
"By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ?"
"We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too ."
"Thanks a lot . "
"My name's McDonald ."
"Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ?"
"It's M , C , capital D . "
"Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy ."
"A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years ."
"Do you like him ?"
"Yes , I do like him ."
"Then why are you hesitating ?"
"You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted ."
"One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship ."
"Maybe you are right . "
"How's work ?"
"The same as usual . "
"The police need our help finding a robber ."
"How do you know ?"
"The TV news is reporting a bank robbery ."
"Do they know what the robber looks like ?"
"Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old ."
"What race is he ?"
"They didn't say ."
"The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore ."
"Of course not . That would be racist ."
"But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ?"
"Don't ask me ."
"Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . "
"David , imagine meeting you here !"
"Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ?"
"All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers ."
"It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning ."
"How many vegetables do you steal today ?"
"I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm ."
"So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work ."
"I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing ."
"I really want to be far away from the reality now ."
"But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . "
"Mom ?"
"Mm ?"
"Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ?"
"Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ?"
"Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart ."
"Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ?"
"Yes . "
"Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald ."
"Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ?"
"He ’ s nearly 90 ."
"Good gracious ! Are you sure ?"
"I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 ."
"Is she really ?"
"Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband ."
"Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? "
"I wanna register for this mathematics course ."
"I ’ m sorry registration has closed ."
"Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes ."
"Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ?"
"Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee ."
"She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ?"
"She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is ."
"Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine ."
"Serious ? Only the proof of my address ."
"Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information ."
"But it ’ s unfair ."
"Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can ."
"Great ."
"Don ’ t get your hopes up . "
"What ? I don't get it ... , Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy ."
"Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy ."
"He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance ."
"I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... , Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! "
"Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?"
"My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country ."
"Is it really completely flat ?"
"Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country ."
"Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries ."
"The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches ."
"That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs ."
"There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes ."
"We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . "
"Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck ."
"Guess what ? He has just got the sack ."
"Oh , is that so ?"
"Exactly . "
"Is this your new teacher ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"Is she short ?"
"No , she ’ s average ."
"What color are her eyes ?"
"They ’ re dark gray ."
"What color is her hair ?"
"It ’ s blond ."
"And how old is she ?"
"I don ’ t know . "
"Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ?"
"Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it !"
"I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday ."
"I think Mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much . "
"I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday ."
"Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?"
"All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers ."
"Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive !"
"Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you ."
"Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring ."
"It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week ."
"But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?"
"Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?"
"Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first ."
"Oh , I know . Thank you . "
"The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police ."
"Because it was her husband who beat her ."
"It is incredible ."
"She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . "
"How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ?"
"Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation ."
"You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ?"
"I want to try different things before I find the one I really like ."
"Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ?"
"I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new ."
"How's your current job going ?"
"I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . "
"If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know ."
"I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it ."
"Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it ."
"I'll try . "
"It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner ."
"Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony ."
"This dish is really delicious ."
"I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it ."
"You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ?"
"Sure , we call it doubt . "
"Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine ."
"Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading ."
"You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library ."
"Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet ."
"Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ?"
"No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice ."
"Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world ."
"I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages ."
"So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics ."
"That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . "
"Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ?"
"Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ?"
"Yes , I do ."
"Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . "
"The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends ."
"That ’ s really unbearable ."
"But you know , things cannot always go as you expect ."
"So get prepared for everything . "
"Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ?"
"I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime ."
"No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?"
"I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall ."
"You must have a wonderful time ."
"Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?"
"No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . "
"Is there a lot of crime in your city ?"
"There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime ."
"It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs ."
"That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for , Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach ."
"I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others ."
"That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . "
"Why do you like this computer ?"
"It's user friendly . "
"Good game ?"
"Not bad . But too hot for me today ."
"Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?"
"Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?"
"Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners ."
"Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ?"
"16 . Yours ?"
"No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob ."
"Jane . Nice to meet you ."
"Me too . So , do you like the course ?"
"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?"
"Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns ."
"Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased ."
"Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them ."
"Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?"
"Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !"
"How awful , poor guy ."
"Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him ."
"Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?"
"Yup . "
"What are you doing ?"
"I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class ."
"There are no countries marked on the map ."
"No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world ."
"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny ."
"I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall ."
"Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you ."
"The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate ."
"It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . "
"I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent ."
"I'll try to speak more clearly . "
"Why do you look so sad ?"
"I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time ."
"Why not go and see a doctor ?"
"I never trust those stupid doctors . "
"Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics ."
"She must be very sad ."
"Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now ."
"At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . "
"John dates her seven times a week ."
"Really ? That's a straws in the wind ."
"I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her ."
"Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . "
"Do you like traveling , Kathy ?"
"I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... , Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving ."
"Exactly . "
"Hello , Jane !"
"Hi , Tom . How have you been ?"
"Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . "
"What are you doing ?"
"What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ?"
"Mumm . no ."
"It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off ."
"What ?"
"The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa , I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl ."
"This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g , Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me ."
"Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec , All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !"
"Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . "
"Do you often do exercise ?"
"Certainly ."
"OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ?"
"I often play badminton with my parents ."
"You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket ."
"Hey , I'm good at playing it ."
"Says who ?"
"My parents ."
"Oh , I see ."
"How about you , Daniel ?"
"I'm a real man , and I like football ."
"Well , who is your favorite football player ?"
"I like Renaldo the most . "
"Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy ."
"Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before ."
"No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department ."
"What do you do there ?"
"I main market reasearch , and you ?"
"I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him ."
"Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ?"
"Yes , That's him over there-the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ?"
"Thanks , that's would be lovely . You'r right , he is kind and nice looking . "
"Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking ."
"Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues ."
"But what are the sources of water pollution ?"
"They could generally be divided into two categories , Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc ."
"aren ’ t they ?"
"Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies ."
"But what about the indirect ones ?"
"Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater ."
"I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it ."
"Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . "
"Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?"
"Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean ."
"How often do you run your anti-virus program ?"
"I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time ."
"Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?"
"How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free ."
"That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?"
"Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated ."
"What do you use your computer for ?"
"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones ."
"Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some program and learn how to use them . "
"You seem to have all the jitters about Jane ."
"Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match ."
"Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon ."
"I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her . "
"Thanks for your help ."
"No problem , anytime ."
"Let me know if I can do anything for you ."
"Okay , thank you . "
"How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events ."
"We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display ."
"Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ?"
"If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend ."
"Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities ."
"Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives ."
"We could have another on the successes of graduates from here ."
"I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that ."
"That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university ."
"I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni ."
"A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film ."
"I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . "
"Your knowledge of English is really surprising ."
"Oh , it's nothing to speak of ."
"No , seriously . I'm impressed ."
"Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . "
"Excuse me , are you Miss Green ?"
"Yes . May I help you ?"
"May I introduce myself ?"
"Yes ."
"I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John ."
"Nice to meet you , John ."
"It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . "
"Have you considered upgrading your system ?"
"Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need ."
"You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising ."
"That would be a definite bonus ."
"You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now ."
"How can we do that ?"
"You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ?"
"No ."
"Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds ."
"That sounds great . Thanks . "
"Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day ."
"I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ?"
"Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop ."
"Right !"
"I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little ."
"Ok ."
"Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful ."
"Ahahah , and I thought you were tired ."
"You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses ."
"It sure looks special , looks expensive too ."
"Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ?"
"Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered ."
"Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . "
"I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?"
"Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices ."
"The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first ."
"Why not start with the most interesting one ?"
"Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision ."
"Toss a coin to decide then . "
"I want to try my hand at the stocks ."
"It is very hard , you know ."
"Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard ."
"Good luck ! "
"Hello , is this People's Theater ?"
"Yes , it is . May I help you ?"
"Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ?"
"What date , sir ?"
"October 16th ."
"Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ?"
"7:30 p . m . performance , please ."
"OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan ."
"I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please ."
"All right . May I have you name , please ?"
"Du Kun ."
"When would you like to collect the tickets ?"
"Tomorrow ."
"We can hold them until one day before the show ."
"How do we cancel , just in case ?"
"Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation ."
"All right , thank you very much . Good bye ."
"You are welcome . Goodbye . "
"I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right , I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs ."
"Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ?"
"In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter ."
"So many ?"
"This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences ."
"Have you heard of Tiger Woods ?"
"Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . "
"Do you remember John from head office ?"
"Yes ."
"Have you heard what happened to him ?"
"No , what ?"
"He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in ."
"Crikey . Where did this happen ?"
"In Taichung , I think ."
"Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there ."
"Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car ."
"So what happened ?"
"Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing ."
"That's terrible ."
"Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?"
"So what happened next ?"
"Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away ."
"Well , he sure was lucky ."
"I'll say . "
"I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband ."
"Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college ."
"So what ? Things have changed . "
"At last ! The weekend comes again !"
"Yes . What will you do these two days ?"
"After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun ."
"But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . "
"Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again ."
"Ah ? Really ? That stinks !"
"Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ?"
"Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled ."
"Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . "
"Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous ."
"I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday !"
"I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say ."
"Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me ."
"You ’ re the best ! "
"I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time ."
"What happened ?"
"I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on ."
"Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! "
"Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ?"
"Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently ."
"Yes . They used to be joined at the hip ."
"I heard they were just married for half a year ."
"That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things ."
"Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock ."
"You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage ."
"Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married ."
"Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . "
"Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ?"
"I usually go to the supermarket , near the station ."
"How do you find the prices there ?"
"I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh ."
"I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?"
"Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . "
"There's a typhoon coming ."
"Is that right ?"
"That's what the weatherman said last night . "
"Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ?"
"Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday ."
"Oh wow . How was it ?"
"Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ?"
"Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though ."
"Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road ."
"What a great idea . "
"Ben always appears rude to the people around him ."
"But he's really kind at heart ."
"That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . "
"I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here ."
"I trust you ’ re keeping well ?"
"I'm doing great , thank you ."
"So we can get down to business . "
"What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ?"
"Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' ."
"Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation ."
"I still think nobody plays for nothing . "
"So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?"
"Nine total . Seven children and my parents ."
"Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?"
"Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it ."
"Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right ."
"It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make ."
"Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy ."
"That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs ."
"And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common ."
"Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . "
"Is there a city where it's always warm ?"
"Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example ."
"Are there any other cities where it's always hot ?"
"Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year ."
"But why do so many people live there ?"
"Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time ."
"Are there any cities where it rains a lot ?"
"Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon ."
"Tell us about some cold cities ."
"In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them ."
"Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ?"
"Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . "
"I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with ."
"You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody ."
"You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is ."
"Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp ."
"Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker ."
"You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience ."
"Maybe that's why he's so nice ! "
"I hear little Bob has recovered ."
"That's a great relief . I was worried about him ."
"The operation was very successful ."
"His parents must feel very happy . "
"I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !"
"Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !"
"Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !"
"Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?"
"That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute !"
"I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception ."
"That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ?"
"Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? "
"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?"
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !"
"That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest ."
"What does that mean ?"
"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer ."
"Me ! Me !"
"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this ."
"Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !"
"Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency ."
"Well , OK . But no French kissing !"
"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times ."
"Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! "
"You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself ."
"Sure , what gives ?"
"Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class !"
"On the level ?"
"I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating ."
"That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning ."
"It serves her right ! "
"This is my uncle , Charles ."
"He looks strong.What does he do ?"
"He's a captain ."
"He must be very brave ."
"Exactly ! "
"OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building ."
"It ’ s huge ."
"Would you like to go to the top ?"
"Yes , of course ."
"The view is breath-taking . "
"Hi , how ’ re you doing ?"
"Terrible ."
"Oh , what ’ s the matter ?"
"I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache ."
"Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ?"
"I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help ."
"Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor ."
"Yeah , I guess I should ."
"Well , you ’ d better get some rest ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Bye . "
"I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone ."
"Calm down . "
"Let me see . How much should I pay for you ?"
"Don ’ t think about it !"
"No , this will not do . Let me see ."
"You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up ."
"Good ideas . "
"Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ?"
"Really ? Why ?"
"He had moved and held a party on July 1st ."
"It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time ."
"Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends ."
"You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . "
"I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths ."
"Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician ."
"I ’ m so thirsty ."
"Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home ."
"No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink ."
"I ’ ll buy you a drink ."
"Oh ! Thank you . "
"How long will it take us to drive to London ?"
"I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway ."
"That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours ."
"You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area ."
"So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?"
"Ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?"
"No . let me take a look ... It ’ s longer than my car ."
"I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour ."
"Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway ."
"We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . "
"I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ?"
"Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do , That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 , But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 ."
"The advertised rate is based on double occupancy ."
"When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that ."
"Are you quite sure ?"
"Yes . Have a look ."
"I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page ."
"Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate ."
"Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim ."
"Thank you . "
"Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?"
"Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup ."
"What was that ?"
"Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally ."
"Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back ."
"Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me ."
"I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !"
"He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway !"
"Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set ."
"How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ?"
"Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?"
"Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... , ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... , Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ?"
"Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you ."
"Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle ."
"The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?"
"These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful ."
"Can I check this one out ?"
"I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it ."
"Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out ."
"All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday ."
"Thanks for your help . "
"Are there any seats left for Saturday night ?"
"I still have five seats in the mezzanine ."
"I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ?"
"No . Nothing . I'm sorry . "
"Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?"
"Sorry , it ’ s all sold out ."
"Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?"
"We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m ."
"Ok . I ’ ll take it ."
"Where would you like to sit ?"
"Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes ."
"Certainly . "
"You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own ."
"If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me ."
"I ’ ll be very glad if you would help ."
"I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture ."
"Thank you . I wish I would ."
"Good luck to you . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?"
"These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful ."
"Can I check this one out ?"
"I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it ."
"Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out ."
"All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday ."
"Thanks for your help . "
"Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other ."
"In what ways ?"
"Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible , Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ?"
"What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life ."
"Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes !"
"But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me !"
"But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met ."
"Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . "
"When is your birthday ?"
"August 1st ."
"Do you usually have a birthday party ?"
"Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me ."
"What would you do at the party ?"
"We sing "" Happy Birthday "" at the party and have birthday cakes ."
"Do you know when people began to sing the song "" Happy Birthday "" ?"
"Well , I don't know ."
"Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune ."
"So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ?"
"Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . "
"Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes !"
"It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... , Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing !"
"I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ?"
"I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! "
"You got a letter in the mail ."
"Give it to me ."
"What is it ?"
"It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA ."
"What does it say ?"
"I ’ Ve been accepted !"
"Are you serious ?"
"I ’ m serious ."
"Good for you !"
"NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine ."
"I ’ m so proud of you ."
"Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . "
"DO you have any plan for your future ?"
"I'd prefer to go abroad , if possible ."
"Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend ."
"I'm one of them . "
"Too bad you missed Jane's performance ."
"How's it ?"
"It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . "
"Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful ."
"Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?"
"Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ?"
"Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge ."
"The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?"
"Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed ."
"When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree ."
"Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect ."
"Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . "
"I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 ."
"Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel ."
"A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like ."
"I prefer boxing to beef . "
"What happened to your brother ?"
"It seems that he has gone ape over the girl ."
"Your parents must be worrying about him ."
"Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do ."
"Have you talked to him ?"
"Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen . "
"Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine ."
"It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important ."
"What methods do you use to conserve water ?"
"Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water ."
"I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution ."
"Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry ."
"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced ."
"The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it ."
"I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . "
"Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto ."
"Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you ."
"A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you ."
"Thank you , they are beautiful . "
"hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it ."
"is it a horror movie ?"
"yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?"
"no way . I will be scared out of my wits ."
"that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside ."
"Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ?"
"alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?"
"Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on ."
"that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies ."
"yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned ."
"not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy ."
"the Notebook is this type of movie ."
"really ? I haven't heard of it ."
"well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it ."
"Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! "
"Congratulations on the new house !"
"Thanks ! We love it ."
"Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful ."
"I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! "
"Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people ."
"Who ’ s that boy ?"
"Where ?"
"The one next to the telephone ."
"I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ?"
"I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . "
"All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth ."
"What's happening in that country ?"
"The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs . "
"What ’ s the matter , BOB ?"
"I think it ’ s my ankle ."
"What happened ?"
"One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks ."
"Can you stand ?"
"I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore ."
"what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat ."
"It ’ s that really necessary ?"
"It maybe worse than it seems . "
"What a brilliant smile !"
"That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling ."
"He must be very easy-going ."
"Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . "
"Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ?"
"I have no idea . "
"Hello , Mary . How are you ?"
"Not bad . How about you , John ?"
"Fine . Thank you . "
"When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is ."
"But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds ."
"And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent ."
"How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . "
"Hi , Sue . What's up ?"
"Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ?"
"Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently ."
"Really ? What's he been doing ?"
"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now ."
"Are you ? What are you busy with ?"
"Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . "
"So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?"
"Stolen ? No , why ?"
"My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days ."
"Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless ."
"I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good ."
"If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened ."
"He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too ."
"Didn ’ t anyone stop them ?"
"You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away ."
"Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all ."
"That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . "
"A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?"
"I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?"
"Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals ."
"Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills ."
"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance ."
"Ok , then we can sign up for it together . "
"Would you like any toast , dear ?"
"Um ?"
"Toast , dear ?"
"As you like ."
"Would you like any tea , dear ?"
"It doesn ’ t make any difference to me ."
"Oh , you ’ re not listening to me ."
"Leave me alone . "
"Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ?"
"No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet ."
"How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you ."
"How do you do ?"
"Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home ."
"What would you like to drink ?"
"A cup of coffee , please . "
"So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ?"
"I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came ."
"Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping ."
"I love the museums , too ."
"But the traffic is pretty bad ."
"Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy ."
"Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ?"
"I can't stand making decisions . You choose !"
"OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? "
"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted ."
"You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard ."
"You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . "
"Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes ."
"Me too . I'll talk to you later ."
"OK . See you later . "
"Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God ."
"Do you really think so ?"
"Yeah , you have some other ideas ?"
"I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us ."
"For example ?"
"We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air ."
"Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . "
"Bye , mom !"
"Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on !"
"OK . Bye !"
"No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens ."
"Alright . See ya !"
"Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf ."
"Ok , see you after school ... , Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go ."
"Mom ?"
"Yes , honey ... , I ... I can ’ t breathe . "
"Who is your favorite music composer ?"
"I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin ."
"Then you must despise such modern music as rock ?"
"Without doubt , rock is trash . "
"Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China ."
"Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red ."
"That must be very beautiful ."
"Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies ."
"Really ? Have you ever been there ?"
"A couple of times ."
"Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me ."
"Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . "
"Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ?"
"I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason ."
"Really ? Say it !"
"Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ?"
"Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family ."
"Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man ."
"Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves ."
"In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . "
"How's your girlfriend ?"
"We broke up . "
"I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off ."
"I apologize . This should not have to be this way ."
"Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time ."
"Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . "
"You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ?"
"Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning ."
"But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ?"
"It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them ."
"That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later ."
"Working at weekend is something I hate to do most ."
"But if the company asks , what else can we do ? "
"Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ?"
"I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat ."
"Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person ."
"Stop complaining , OK ?"
"No wonder you are named shopaholic ."
"No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags ."
"Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . "
"You did well on the math test ."
"Of course ."
"Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ?"
"Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius ."
"Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ?"
"B :: Come on ! I just took a glance ."
"Are you crazy ? You were cheating . "
"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance ."
"John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom ."
"I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning ."
"Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ?"
"Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight ."
"I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families ."
"I think you ’ re right ! "
"I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert ."
"Sure . How do you like your seats ?"
"Ordinary one , please ."
"Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 ."
"I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 ."
"That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . "
"Who are we going to play with today ?"
"We are playing against Hainan ."
"Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team ."
"Sure they are ."
"Who's winning ?"
"We are , 27 to 26 ."
"Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now ."
"How can it be ? We are a tough team as well . "
"How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ?"
"Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon ."
"You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?"
"Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it ."
"Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . "
"What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous !"
"You , too . Where did you get your new hat ?"
"From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?"
"Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband !"
"Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married ."
"He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon !"
"She's chic , isn't she ?"
"Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed ."
"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say ."
"Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her ."
"Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate ."
"I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !"
"The gown is quite expensive , believe me ."
"So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar ."
"You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon ."
"You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure ."
"Thanks . I'm flattered ."
"Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . "
"Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out !"
"Hey , watch where you ’ re going !"
"Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ?"
"Oh ... I don ’ t know ."
"I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies ."
"Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere ."
"Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting ."
"Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ?"
"Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . "
"Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ?"
"A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest ."
"That it easy.They get caught before they come here ."
"Stop your nonsense ! Quick . Let ’ s leave the place ! "
"People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable ."
"And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ?"
"Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving ."
"Then what are the Westerners fit for ?"
"I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc ."
"Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ?"
"It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon ."
"I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . "
"What ’ s the plot of your new movie ?"
"It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !"
"Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director ."
"I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much ."
"Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ?"
"Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think ."
"Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?"
"I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future ."
"Thank you very much for doing this interview ."
"My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ?"
"Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . "
"It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon ."
"That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . "
"have you ever thought about your ideal home ?"
"I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself ."

"how many rooms would it have ?"
"I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t , how many bedrooms would your dream home have ?"
"I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three ."
"how would you decorate your house ?"
"I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b , how many TVs would your dream home have ?"
"I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . "
"Susan has got married ."
"Really ? How do you know that ?"
"Her marriage was a hole and corner affair ."
"Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ?"
"I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ... "
"Hi , how is it going ?"
"Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know ."
"That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here ."
"Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . "
"What a surprise meeting you here , Landy ."
"I ’ m here as a tourist ."
"It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . "
"Do you have any year-end benefits ?"
"I don ’ t know till now ."
"I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits ."
"Why they hold a flour war ?"
"They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card ."
"They are not feeling satisfied ?"
"It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves ."
"But how guilty to waste food ! "
"Jason , it's your turn ."
"I hope I get an easy question like you did ."
"You rolled a four . Let's see ... you landed on Foreign Films ."
"Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies ."
"Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ?"
"Oh , please ! I have no idea ."
"The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English . "
"I'm leaving now , mum ."
"Take care , sonny !"
"I will.Bye - bye !"
"Bye ! "
"You hoo , anybody here ?"
"Over here , Betty !"
"Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well ."
"Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself ."
"No way . Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas ."
"No kidding ! What happened to Ad ?"
"Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too ."
"Was , talk about a double whammy ."
"Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving ."
"Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her ."
"Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK ."
"Thanks for the visit , Betty . "
"I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods ."
"Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ?"
"I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that ."
"My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?"
"Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ?"
"What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now ."
"But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?"
"It seems that I have nothing to do , except this ."
"Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . "
"Then I'll have to borrow it ."
"Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month ."
"Why ? It's in mint condition !"
"That's why I can profit from it !"
"You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ?"
"You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... , I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! "

"What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head ."
"Do people here drink a lot of liquors ?"
"Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate ."

"I'm sure they are wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost ."
"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there ."

"Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place ."
"OK . Thank you . "

"I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level ."

It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for ."

"No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement ."

"Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company ."
"And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects ."
"It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me ."
"My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . "
"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?"
"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?"
"Of course , you have . You must try harder this time ."
"And must I go back to school ?"
"No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes ."
"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 ."
"You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study ."
"What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?"
"Who knows ! That might come to later . "

"What would it be like ?"
"Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me ."

"How would you decorate your house ?"
"I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets ."
"How many TVs would your dream home have ?"

I think , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office "

"Mary ! I haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with Mr . Lee last week . Where have you been hiding yourself lately ?"
"Oh , hi Mike . I ’ Ve been out of town the last few days . What did you need ?"
"Really , nothing big . I just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and I wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department ."

"Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ?"
"Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues ."
"Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work ."
"That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off ."
"You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break !"

"Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . "
"Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?"
"Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?"
"Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?"
"Yes , it will print immediately . "
"Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ?"
"I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old ."
"Oh you ’ re so kind !"
"Get in . "

"Can you even hear what he's saying ?"
"No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating !"
"Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken ."
"All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! "

"What else will they ask me ?"
"One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work . "

"Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ?"

"Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off , Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey , Can I write that down ?"
"Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages ."
"Thanks ."
"And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ?"
"Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year ."
"Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart ."
"What are those stores ?"
"They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom ."
"Even silverware ?"
"Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient ."
"I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ?"
"I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store ."
"What does that mean ?"
"That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics ."
"Electronics ?"
"Yes . Like stereos and televisions ."
"How much is the membership fee ?"
"I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all , I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things ."
"I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . "
"Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian ?"
"Yes ."
"How many days does it take to Dalian ?"
"About one day . It arrives in Dalian at 10:00 a . m . tomorrow ."
"How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao ?"
"Four ports ."
"The ship is going very fast ."

"Because I ’ m very competent in this area ."
"Can you working under pressure ?"
"Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines ."
"Are you more a follower or a leader ?"
"I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . "
"Ouch , it ’ s unbearable ."
"Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave ."

"Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ?"
"Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting !"
"Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... , But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients ."
"Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! "

"I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids ."
"What ? Why ?"
"Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages ."
"Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction ."
"Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses ."
"I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea ."
"I will bring it up over Sunday brunch ."
"Good luck with that ! "

"Have you invested in the stock market before ?"
"No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now ."

"Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ?"
"Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst ."

"What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?"
"I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk ."
"Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ?"
"I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . "

"I think I can handle it by myself ."
"I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company ."
"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility ."

"That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible ."
"Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . "

"Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup ."
"Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running ."
"That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only ."
"In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives ."
"Anything to get me up and running ."
"For starters , we have a computer lab ."
"Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ?"
"The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing ."
"That's fine . Now tell me about the other alternatives ."
"Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here ."
"Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ?"
"Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs . "
"Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road ."
"Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call ."
"Of course . It's urgent . I think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis . He may die if not treated in time ."
"All right , we'll come right away ."
"( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ?"

"Don't worry . We'll put him in the stretcher . You are coming with us ? Step in please ."
"Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are ."
"Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room ."
"( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor , He had appendicitis , but is all right now that it was removed . He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover ."
"May I send food for him ?"
"No , outside food is not permitted ."
"Can I come round to see him tomorrow ?"
"Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m . By the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward ."
"Yes . Thank you ."
"By the way , you can bring some flowers ."
"OK ."
"Don't worry about him ."
"When could I take care of him ?"
"Our nurse can take good care of him . "
"Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing ."
"I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city ."
"Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ?"
"That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much ."
"It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near ."
"OK , let ’ s go . "
"Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland ."
"We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall !"
"He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track ."
"The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go !"
"Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead !"
"How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! "

"I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success ."
"Why do you think so ?"
"I think building team spirit among the coworkers is very important . I believe we can accomplish a miracle if we stick together ."
"Very good . Anything else ?"
"My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience ."
"I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ?"
"I will listen and learn more when I start my new job . I plan to become more professional in my field ."
"I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job ."
"Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn . "

"I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else ."

"so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift ."
"my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b , that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?"
"most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help , so , what did you get them ?"
"I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems ."
"what ’ s wrong with is ?"
"she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise ."
"household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays ."
"I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year "
"Hello , are you interested in this Honda ?"
"Hi , I am just looking ."
"It's a good car ."
"What year is it ?"
"1999 ."
"How about the mileage ?"
"6,000 miles , all highway mileage ."
"What do you mean 7B , Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much ."
"Oh , why such a high mileage ?"
"The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line ."
"Okay . Does this car have a warranty ?"
"One month ."
"How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ?"
"You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage ."
"How much is it ?"
"$ 5,900 ."
"I'll have to think about it ."
"Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced ."
"Okay . "
"It's very nice of you to invite me ."
"I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ?"
"Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ?"
"Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste ."
"Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste ."
"Mr . Liu , would you care for another helping ?"
"No more , thank you . I'm quite full ."
"Did you enjoy the meal ?"
"It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner ."
"I'm so glad you like it ."
"Thank you very much for your hospitality . "
"The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues ."
"Why , what's the lowdown ?"
"According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups ."
"I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account ."
"No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques ."
"That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ?"
"I think Euros will be the best , as I'll only be in Mainland Europe ."
"Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ?"
"5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks ."
"Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ?"
"That would be perfect , thank you . "
"Have you always been on this site ?"
"No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York ."
"Why did you move ?"
"We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . "
"I want to open an account ."
"What kind of account do you want to open ?"
"I want to open a checking account ."
"Do you know the minimum balance you ’ re required to keep ?"
"How much is that ?"
"You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100 ."
"Really ?"
"Yes , really ."
"What if I can ’ t meet that requirement ?"
"You will be fined ."
"How much is the fine ?"
"It ’ s going to cost you $ 25 . "
"can I get you something to drink ?"
"sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order ."
"so how about an aperitif ?"
"it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare ."
"stirred or shaken ?"
"stirred will be fine ."
"here you are ."
"thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ?"
"sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail ."
"can you recommend one ?"
"try a Singer . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice ."
"it sounds interesting . I'll take one ."
"here we go ."
"it tastes great ."
"enjoy yourself ."
"yeah . "
"Kevin ? Hi , it ’ s Elizabeth . I have a big favor to ask you ."
"How big , Elizabeth ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 3 nights in a row !"
"Well , I ’ Ve got a huge load of typing and Mr . Blake has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon ."
"All right , Elizabeth . But this is the last time . "
"My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ?"
"If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first ."
"How ?"
"You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up ."
"Very useful advice , I will try them right now . "
"I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration ."
"That's right ."
"So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper ."
"I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism ."
"But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ?"
"I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news ."
"A new reporter must expect to work many hours ."
"I know that starting reporters work many hours . I'm very willing to take on the challenge . "
"What's wrong ?"
"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode ."
"You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her ."
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me ."
"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" ."
"But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?"
"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options ."
"Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up ."
"This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable ."
"Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more ."
"This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it ."
"Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . "
"I like this shirt.How much is it ?"
"$ 135 ."
"Wow , that's sheer robbery.Shall I make an offer ?"
"I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed . "
"Good morning . Your ticket and passport , please ?"
"Here you are ."
"Do you have any baggage to check in ?"
"Yes , one box ."
"Would you please put it on the scale ?"
"OK . By the way , can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed ?"
"The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket . What class are you travelling ?"
"First-class ."
"For a first-class passenger , the free baggage allowance is forty kilos ."
"How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane ?"
"Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane ."
"If my baggage exceeds the allowance , what should I do ?"
"If the checked baggage is over the allowance , we will charge you for the overweight ."
"I see . Thank you very much for your information ."
"You're welcome . Your boarding pass and baggage check , please ."
"Goodbye ! "
"Tell me something about yourself and your past ."
"I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years ."
"What was the most significant project you've worked on ?"
"I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team ."
"What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?"
"For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area ."
"How would your coworkers evaluate you ?"
"They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . "
"Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris ."
"Then you must hurry up.There ' s only ten minutes left ."
"Until we meet again . "
"I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week ."
"To cancel your reservation , I need your name , phone number , and date of trip , please ."
"Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 . My reservation begins on the second Monday of April ."
"I see your reservation on my computer . Let me just cancel it , and you'll be all set !"
"Thanks . I'll call again when things get better at home ."
"You're welcome . "
"This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep !"
"Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ?"
"I'll have whatever you're having ."
"OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer !"
"Well ... the beer sounds good ! "
"Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small ."
"I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper ."
"A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop ."
"Here ’ s an interesting ad , How much is the rent ?"
"The ad says $ 325 plus deposit ."
"When is the place available ?"
"It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . "
"I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers ."
"Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along ."
"What should I have brought with me ?"
"The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers ."
"I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers ."
"Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time ."
"My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question ."
"Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents ."
"Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine ?"
"At the close of escrow , the house will be yours ! "
"Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ?"
"I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book ."
"OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ?"
"Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside ."
"OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure ."
"OK , it's 672910 . "
"Do you take in students ?"

"How much is it ?"
"$ 30.00 a week ."
"Do you think I could have a look at it , please ."
"I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? "
"Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ?"
"Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ?"
"Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary ."
"Which is the best way ?"
"It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ?"
"$ 800 ."
"Why don't you send it by mail payment order ?"
"How long does it take ?"
"About a week ."
"I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ?"
"Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer ."
"And how long do those take ?"
"Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank ."
"I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ?"
"You have to fill out this form , ma'am . "
"I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute ."
"But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before !"
"It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses ."
"So the company will pay for everything ?"
"Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know ."
"That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ?"
"I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . "
"Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ?"
"Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth ."
"Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays ."
"Is it gonna hurt ?"
"No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax ."
"Ok , spit . "
"I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game !"
"Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !"
"At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go ."
"I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?"
"Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness ."
"I know it is quite different from Western chess ."
"Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill ."
"But isn't it the same with wiki ?"
"Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . "
"Nice to meet you ."
"Nice to meet you , too ."
"You are a graduate , right ?"
"I recently graduated from college as an English major ."
"So you don't have much related work experience ."
"Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort ."
"Well , did you get any honors or rewards in college ?"
"I have got a Business English Certificate and a Certificate of TEM 8 ."
"What about your computer skills ?"
"I got professional training in this field , and I believe I can fit the position well ."
"And anything else ?"
"I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English , I see ."
"Your approval would be my honor . "
"Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much ."
"Just what are you proposing ?"
"We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % ."
"That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ?"
"I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ?"
"Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this ."
"Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else ."
"I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground ."
"I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % ."
"Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat ."
"Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . "
"Hello . What can I do for you ?"
"Hello . I'm here to get my salary ."
"I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction ."
"No problem ."
"And how much of your salary would you like ?"
"I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough . "
"Rachel ? This is John Emory speaking ."
"Yes , Mr . Emory ?"
"I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch ."
"I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . "

"You really do a good job . "
"So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ?"
"Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline ."
"You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?"
"Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . ."
"I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !"
"I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures ."
"I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ?"
"Let me see , the buying rate is RIB 808 per $ 100 . How much would you like to change ?"
"$ 200 altogether ."
"Would you mind showing me your passport ?"
"Here it is . And how much RIB shall I get ?"
"Let me see . $ 200 makes RIB 1,616 . Here is the cash and exchange memo . Please check it ."
"That's correct . Thank you very much . "
"Give me enough for a skirt , will you ?"
"Here you are.It ' s 90 yuan , miss ."
"Can you give me a discount ?"
"20 percent is the best discount I can offer . That will came to 72yuan ."
"OK . 72 yuan ."
"Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in ."
"No , Thanks.Not today ."
"I'll just have this all wrapped up for you . "
"What do you charge for the sports shoes ?"
"$ 60 ."
"Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ?"
"Yes , the shoes on that shelf are on sale now . They are much cheaper . "
"May I help you ?"
"Have you any package tour to Italy ?"
"Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy ."
"How long does the route No . 5 last ?"
"2 weeks . Is that OK ?"
"We have just 10 days for the vacation . "
"Do you give me a bonus ?"
"Yes . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses ."
"Do you allow any commission ?"
"Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . "
"Hello , have you made a reservation ?"
"No , are there any vacant beds for us ?"
"Of course.How do you like your room ?"
"Just an ordinary one , six people living in a room ."
"OK , how long are you staying ?"
"3 days . "
"How many do you intend to order for our shirts ?"
"What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ?"
"We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen ."
"No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ?"
"Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured ."
"And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount ."
"Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent ."
"That's great . "
"I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight ."
"I'm sorry , sir . Exactly what is the problem ?"
"I'm knee-deep in cockroaches !"
"I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also ."
"Thank you . I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact ."
"Sir , we always try to please our guests . "
"We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ?"
"Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap ."
"But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... , It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... , How much do you think it would cost ?"
"Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light ."
"$ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive !"
"It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well ."
"Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens ."
"No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . "
"I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries ."
"They think you are just a child ."
"But the child has his own feeling ."
"Maybe you are right . Well , you can talk with them . "
"Hi , Sir . What can I do for you ?"
"Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here ."
"Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear ."
"Is there any way we can speed it up ?"
"There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end . "
"Are you looking for an apartment ?"
"Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square ."
"I think I have just a right apartment for you ."
"Oh , good . Can you describe it ?"
"Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens ."
"So is there a refrigerator ?"
"Yes , it ’ s brand-new ."
"It sounds great . How much is the rent ?"
"It ’ s $ 8.50 a month ."
"When can I see it ?"
"We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me ."
"Ok , that would be great . "
"Good afternoon , how can I help ?"
"Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ?"
"Of course . Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account . How much would you like to withdraw ?"
"I'd like 20,000 RIB , please . If that's possible ."
"No problem . Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account . "
"Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English ."
"Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop ."
"Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing ."
"Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... , Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just ."
"Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with "" Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ?"
"Great , okay . "" Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine "" ."
"That's great ... , "" The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... "" , Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her ."
"Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with "" All the best , Tracy "" ."
"Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with "" Yours Sincerely "" . That's more professional ."
"Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! "
"Bruno's ."
"Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant ."
"Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ?"
"There will be about 18 people ."
"Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back ."
"Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ?"
"No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge ."
"That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ?"
"The cake is no problem at all , but we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant ."
"Oh , that's fine ."
"Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ?"
"Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 ."
"Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements ."
"Sounds good . Thanks for your help ."
"Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . "
"Rachel ? I ’ m not sure how you want to handle this account . I think there are a few things to be sorted out ."
"I agree , Toni . I think the biggest problem we ’ re facing is how to bring it in under budget ."
"That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set ."
"Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . "
"Why have you decided to change jobs ?"
"I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field.Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank ."
"Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ?"
"Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here ."
"It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field ."
"I expect to work hard , madam ."
"Do you mind going on frequent business traps ?"
"No , I enjoy travelling . "
"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something ."
"Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files !"
"But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus ."
"Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems ."
"Ok . Anything else ?"
"Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !"
"Um yeah . Sorry about that . "
"I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet ."
"I think you should work out more too ."
"Wow ! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you ."
"I have lost about five kilos ."
"How did you do it ?"
"I was on a diet and exercised daily ."
"I hate working out ."
"You can try a low-impact workout schedule . Why don't you go to a gym ?"
"Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ?"
"The secret is persistence . "
"Hello . Is Becky there , please ?"
"Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free ."
"Thanks ."
"Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now ."
"That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . "
"If I wanted to rent a van , how much would it cost ?"
"Let's see . That would be ¥ 160 a day a mile ."
"That sounds OK . I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th ."
"Do you have a valid license ?"
"Yeah . Here ."
"Fine . Now complete this form and sign your name at the bottom . "
"Have you heard the news ?"
"I haven't heard anything ."
"Deborah had her baby last week ."
"Nobody told me ."
"I thought you heard ."
"I really wasn't told anything ."
"She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces ."
"Wow , how exciting ."
"I know , you should really go and see her and the baby ."
"Of course I will ."
"I just wanted to let you know what happened ."
"I appreciate that . "
"Can you recognize that woman , Millie ?"
"I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress ."
"I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ?"
"That must be Conrad Reeves ."
"Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ?"
"No , He must be her fourth or fifth ."
"Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old !"
"She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty ."
"I ’ m sure she is ."
"She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl ."
"That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ?"
"Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . "
"Hello . This is Doctor Bell ’ s Office . Can I help you ?"
"Hi . This is Taylor Wright calling . I ’ Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9.00 tomorrow morning . I ’ Ve got to cancel this appointment . My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear that . Cancelling the appointment is no problem . Thank you for your call ."
"Thanks a lot . Good bye . "
"Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ?"
"This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on ."
"That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar ."
"The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai ."
"I don't care what others wear . How much is it ?"
"250 Yuan ."
"Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it ."
"But it is really worthwhile ."
"OK , anyway , let me have it ."
"Here you are ."
"Thank you . "
"May I ask you how much this position pays per year ?"
"This job pays sixty-five thousand dollars per year ."

"We provide up-to-date training on state of the art equipment ."
"Where do I sign up for my benefits package ?"
"Down the hall . I'll show you when the interview is over . "
"What is your most preferred training method ?"
"Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues ."
"Well , that is also very efficient , right ?"
"Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet ."
"That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . "
"what are you watching on the telly ?"
"there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes ."
"which one is that ?"
"the office . Have you watched it ?"
"I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version ."
"it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show ."
"what are you watching now ?"
"they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now ."
"I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated ."
"I couldn't agree with you more ."
"have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ?"
"we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch !"
"do you watch a lot of TV then ?"
"I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ?"
"I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ?"
"there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ?"
"why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! "
"You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ?"
"We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment ."
"What about the packaging ?"
"We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . "
"Excuse me , Alex ?"
"What can I do for you , Kim ?"
"I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll ."
"Sure , anytime . "
"Hello , this is Chen Kun . I am booked on flight LJ88 for Barcelona on Jan . 19th ."
"Hold on please ... Yes , you are booked already ."
"Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day . I want to change my flight for the 21st.Is that all right ?"
"I am sorry.Flight LJ88 0n that day is full . What about 22 ?"
"Fine.Thank you so much . "
"Good afternoon . I am Mr . Brown , the Import manager of Atlantic Industries Ltd , Sidney , Australia . This is my card ."

"Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson ."
"Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ?"
"Thank you ."
"What would you like , tea or coffee ?"
"I ’ d prefer coffee if you don ’ t mind ."
"Is it your first trip to the Fair , Mr . Brown ?"
"No , it ’ s the fourth time ."
"Good . Is there anything you find changed about the Fair ?"
"Yes , a great deal . The business scope has been broadened , and there are more visitors than ever before ."
"Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ?"
"Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products ."
"We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ?"
"Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ?"
"All right . "
"Hello , there . What can we do for you today ?"
"I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ?"
"Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already ."
"I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ?"
"Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments ."
"What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ?"

"Working . Why ?"
"Well . I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week ’ s party ."
"I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . "
"Well , tell me something of yourself ."
"What would you like to know , Mr . Green ?"
"What working experience have you got ?"
"In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now ."
"Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?"
"Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . "
"I just received a phone call for an interview next week ."
"Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever ."
"thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ?"
"sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed ."
"yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ?"
"you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil , then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ?"
"smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview , are there any other things I should pay attention to ?"
"yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . "
"Where to , sir ."
"To this place , please ."
"Star Hotel . OK ."
"How long does it take to get to the hotel ?"
"About 20 minutes ."
"Here's the hotel ."
"How much is the fare ?"
"That's 10 dollars . "
"What's your ideal boss ?"
"I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . "
"Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ?"
"It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer ."
"Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?"
"Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend ."
"I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . "
"What do you think a job means to you ?"
"It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development . It can prove your ability ."
"May I ask you why you left the job ?"
"I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs . "
"How can I help you ?"
"Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited . I would like to see Mr . Smith ."
"Do you have an appointment ?"
"Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock ."
"I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p . m . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?"
"Sure ."
"Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?"
"That would be very nice . Thank you ."
"Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor.There is a conference room already prepared . "
"Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ?"
"Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you ."
"That's no trouble , Sir ."
"I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance ."
"Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program ."
"What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all ."
"For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both ."
"That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . "
"Hello , Dana Okro ."
"Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon ."
"Oh , yes . Hi , how are you ?"
"Great . Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer ? It won't take long ."
"Actually , I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes . Is there any literature you can send me ?"
"Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ?"
"Let's do this . Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material , why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now , I'm really sorry , but I have to get going to this meeting ."
"No problem at all . I won't keep you any longer . I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there ."
"Sounds good ."
"Thanks for your time ."
"No problem . Bye , bye . "
"Hi , how are you ?"
"I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here ."
"That's for sure . You're new , too , huh ?"
"Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? "
"Good morning ."
"Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ?"
"Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ?"
"That would be wonderful ."
"We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile ."
"But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ?"
"As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim ."
"OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . "
"What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?"
"Probably nothing ."
"You have to do something romantic ."
"Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means ."
"Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !"
"Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . "
"Now please tell me something about your past work achievements ."
"All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent ."
"That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?"
"I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future ."
"Have you received any honors ?"
"Yes . I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006 ."
"Do you have any publications ?"
"Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily . "
"Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ?"
"Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name ."
"It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ?"
"Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal ."
"So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?"
"I think America really deserves the name of "" fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States ."
"And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ?"
"Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not ."
"But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. , What are they ?"
"Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich ."
"They're much better , But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived ."
"That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal ."
"Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods ."
"I suppose so . "
"Good morning . How can I help you ?"
"I want to apply for a passport here ."
"OK . Please fill in these forms and take them back when you are done ."
"( 10 minutes later . ) Hi . Here are completed forms ."
"OK . Can I have your original ID card and tw0 2 - inch photos ?"
"Here you are , But I forgot my photos ."
"That is OK . We have photo taking service here . You may pay your fee , take a photo there and take it back here ."
"OK . I am going right now . "
"Hello , may I help you ?"
"Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ?"
"Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you ."
"I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates ."
"Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest ."
"You mean there is really not that much of a difference ."
"No , madam . Not very much ."
"Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough ."
"Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ?"
"Ok . "
"Which services offered by your band do you use most ?"
"I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t , Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around ."
"I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash ."
"Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit ."
"Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines ."
"That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too ."
"Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others ."
"I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher ."
"I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use ."
"That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . "
"I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King ."
"Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown ."
"You've had a good trip , I hope ."
"Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you ."
"It's been a full two years since we last saw each other ."
"So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years ."
"We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement ."
"I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products ."
"Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line ."
"Thank you ."
"But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end ."
"That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?"
"500 pieces ."
"No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts ."
"All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission ."
"I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged ."
"We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own ."
"No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction ."
"Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products ."
"Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow ."
"Good , that's all then ."
"Good . "
"What ? What ’ s up ?"
"Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday ."
"Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! "
"What are the branches of Operations ?"
"Operations is made up of Manufacturing , Materials , Shipping and Distribution etc ."
"It seems that it is a key department for providing materials and transportation ."
"Yes , it is . "
"I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment ."
"I would be happy to answer any questions you might have ."
"My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week ."
"What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ?"
"My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period ."
"When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ?"
"Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form ."
"What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away ."
"I am not going to show any income from now on then ."
"I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . "
"Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !"
"Thank you ! Guess how much it costs ."
"Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess ."
"Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five ."
"Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?"
"Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down ."
"How much did she ask for ?"
"Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty ."
"She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ?"
"Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head ."
"Then you pretended to go without buying it ?"
"Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' "
"How can we avoid the jam ?"
"Let's take a roundabout way ."
"OK ."
"Look , traffic jam again ! "
"Hello , is this Professor Clark ?"
"Yes , I am Professor Clark ."
"Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings ."
"Yes , how are you doing ?"
"I was partying hard over the weekend , fell down the stairs , and need time to recuperate ."
"That sounds painful . Are you going to be OK ?"
"I sprained my wrist , but the doctor says it will be fine ."
"How many days will you be out of school ?"
"The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week ."
"I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well ! "
"I need to find a new place to live ."
"Yeah ? Why ? Don ’ t you like living with me ?"
"Oh , it ’ s not you . I just want my own place ."
"Well , check the newspaper ."
"Jeez ... I didn ’ t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days ."
"Yeah , prices have really gone up the past couple of years ."
"Oh , here ’ s one . It ’ s looks like its in this neighborhood , $ 600 a month . That ’ s not to bad ."
"No , it ’ s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ?"
"Hello . I ’ m calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park . Could I take a look at it ? Yes . Tonight at six is fine . Thanks . "
"Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up ."
"Let's have a look . Oh yes , you need a 10 mm ring spanner . Here you are . Just leave it on the workbench when you finish ."
"Thanks for your help ."
"No problem . "
"You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised ."
"Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday ."
"Could I have a look at it first ?"
"Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old ."
"It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom ."
"Yes . And there's a walk-in closet ."
"Is there air conditioning ?"
"Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。 , What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ?"
"It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease ."
"I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease . "
"I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board ."
"Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section ."
"Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning ."
"Did you get a copy of the Herald too ?"
"No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best ."
"That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have ."
"Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ?"
"It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it ."
"I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe ."
"Good idea . "
"Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call ."
"What did he say ?"
"He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job ."
"What kind of intermediary is it ?"
"It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses ."
"What job did he recommend to you ?"
"It's on telemarketing ."
"Does he ask you to pay some fees ?"
"No , he said the employers will pay for it ."
"Then what do you think about it ?"
"I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try ."
"Sure , but you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise ."
"Of course , I will ."
"Good luck ! "
"Can I help you , sir ?"
"Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife ."
"What kind of presents do you want ?"
"Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ?"
"OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America ."
"Hey , How did you know I came from America ?"
"Just a hunch , sir ."
"How much again ?"
"$ 59.95 ."
"That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs ."
"Sorry , sir ."
"Why not ?"
"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife ."
"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume ."
"That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY ."
"DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ?"
"It's $ 60 here ."
"That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ?"
"Of course not , sir ."
"OK , I'll take one . "
"Ouch , it ’ s unbearable ."
"Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave ."
"All right , doctor . But it really hurts . "
"You heard who won the election , right ?"
"Who was elected ?"
"McCain won the election ."
"That can ’ t be true !"
"I ’ m upset , too ."
"I can ’ t believe people voted for him ."
"People must want him as our President ."
"That doesn ’ t make any sense ."
"I have more bad news ."
"How could the news get any worse ?"
"I was only kidding , because Obama won the election ."
"That ’ s great news ! "
"May I help you , ma'ma ?"
"Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ?"
"First you must check in at Counter No . 4 ."
"That one there ?"
"That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 ."
"Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful . "
"Hello ?"
"Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter . I wanted to call you and tell you how much we ’ ll miss her ."
"I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie ."
"What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you ."
"No problem . "
"Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box ."
"I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ?"
"I think you are flicking through it ."
"Well , wait a minute . "
"Are you introverted or extroverted ?"
"I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too ."
"What kind of personality do you think you have ?"
"Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished ."
"What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?"
"For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together ."
"What basic principles do you apply to your life ?"
"Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . "
"You look really wiped out ?"
"I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office ."
"Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning ."
"I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . "
"So , how are you feeling today ?"
"I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well ."
"Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ?"
"I have enough time . I just can ’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep ."
"What time do you usually go to bed ?"
"I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired ."
"Have you been under a lot of stress lately ?"
"I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one ."
"Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ?"
"I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . "
"Good afternoon.Swiss Airline.Miss Grown speaking . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles on Sep . 19th ."
"Just a moment , please . Let me check for you . ( A moment later ) Thank you for waiting . I am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day.The next available flight leaves at 4:00 pm on 20th . Shall I reserve you a seat on it ?"
"Yes , please , thank you . "
"Hello ! How do I restock my minibar ?"
"You've drunk everything , sir ?"
"I finished it all ."
"Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ?"
"Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam ."
"That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers . Anything else , sir ?"
"The apples in my room were delicious . Bring me a few more , please ."
"Okay . Are you sure there isn't anything else ?"
"You know , some grape juice would be really nice , too ."
"Be patient for just a few minutes , sir , and someone will be at your door . "
"Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make ."
"Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?"
"Did you have the room checked before we move in ?"
"Which room are you in ?"
"1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly . The water doesn ’ t run in the shower ."
"I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . ( After checking ) I ’ ll turn to it right away . I do apologize . We ’ ll change your room to 2002 ."
"That ’ s not bad . Thanks for your help ."
"It ’ s my pleasure , Madam . "
"Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ?"
"Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view ."
"You said it . "
"Good morning , Sir ."
"Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ?"
"Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ?"
"10,000 Japanese yen ."
"OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ?"
"Fixed ."
"And how long are you depositing for ?"
"For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . "
"Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back ."
"I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time ."
"Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ?"
"Fine , Mr . Tan . I ’ ll see you then . "
"What do you think of your personality ?"
"I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things ."
"Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?"
"I am quite outgoing , I think ."
"How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ?"
"I try to adapt myself . "
"How about your grades of study ?"
"I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve been awarded Zu Jingle Scholarship two times ."
"Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ?"
"Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accounting through self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA ."
"Have you ever been a student leader ?"
"Yes , I used to be the monitor of my class ."
"Did it affect you much ?"
"It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . "
"Where did you work in the past ?"
"For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd ."
"What's your title in the company ?"
"My title was Project Manager . There were almost 100 people under my supervision . "
"do you have s second ?"
"sure . What do you want ?"
"I want to tell you I've put in my notice ."
"really ? Why ?"
"I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays ."
"and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?"
"yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received , absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade ."
"that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one ."
"this way , you'll earn more at the new work place ."
"that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry ."
"that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead "
"I ’ d like to have this cashed , please ."
"Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport ."
"Yes ."
"How would you like it ?"
"Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please ."
"Ok , here you are . "
"Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use ."
"OK , it so happened I want to buy one ."
"This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat ."
"I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ?"
"Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . "
"We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off , Joe ."
"Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05 , and now it's 16:15 . I guess we have plenty of time ."
"Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in ?"
"Yes.It ' s essential ."
"What about our luggage ?"
"We can check it and hand carry the small bags . And we have to open each for inspection ."
"Are they going to frisk all the passengers ?"
"I think so.We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today . "
"Pam , where's the closest ATM ?"
"It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ?"
"The big one or the small one ?"
"The big one ."
"Yes ."
"It's right next to it , on the right ."
"Do you know if there's a convenience store around here ?"
"I don't think there's one around here . The closest one is on 3rd street , but that's probably closed now ."
"I really need to get some things before I leave ."
"Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day ."
"Can I take the subway to get there ?"
"Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab ."
"Won't that be expensive ?"
"No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars . "
"Do you have any sales experience ?"
"Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl ."
"What kind of work are you doing now ?"
"I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company ."
"Where are you working ?"
"I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . "
"Hi , I need broadband for my computer ."
"No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go ."
"That's a problem . My laptop has no Ethernet port , it's wireless only ."
"Hmm . Well , we have some alternatives , if you're interested ."
"Go ahead . I'm all ears ."
"We have a computer lab on the first floor ."
"That's great ! How much is it ?"
"It's absolutely free to guests . Except for printing , of course ."
"Okay . What about the other alternatives ?"
"You could use your wireless right here in our lobby ."
"Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ?"
"Well , we don't have a printer in the lobby yet . You'll have to use the lab . "
"How do you spend your free time ?"
"I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit ."
"Are you introverted or extroverted ?"
"I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years ."
"What kinds of sports do you like ?"
"I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing ."
"What kind of personality do you think you have ?"
"Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . "
"May I help you ?"
"Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago ."
"Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ?"
"Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . "
"You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ?"
"We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency ."
"If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ?"
"I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least ."
"I'm afraid that's too much for us ."
"We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency ."
"All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal ."
"I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission ."
"You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much ."
"Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent ."
"Oh , that's pitiful . "
"Can you skillfully operate the computer ?"
"Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers ."
"What kind of software can you use ?"
"I can skillfully use Dos , Windows ."
"Do you have any certificates on computer ?"
"Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 ."
"Any other certificates ?"
"Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate ."
"Do you have any other special skills ?"
"I like photography very much . I used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university . "
"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?"
"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !"
"That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest ."
"What does that mean ?"
"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer ."
"Me ! Me !"
"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this ."
"Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !"
"Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency ."
"Well , OK . But no French kissing !"
"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times ."
"Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ?"
"No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly ."
"Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ?"
"Sure . Thanks . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ?"
"Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food ."
"Moon cakes ? What is that ?"
"The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony ."
"Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people ."
"All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style ."
"What's the difference between these two styles ?"
"The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts ."
"Get me some of each ."
"OK , here you are . "
"How would you comment on the paper ?"
"The paper editorials always stick to the quick ."
"Don't you think it's a bit conservative ?"
"After all , I'm somewhat conservative . "
"Hi ! Does this hotel have an exercise facility ?"
"But of course ! We have a great exercise facility ."
"Good . Now exactly where is it ?"
"It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down ."
"Is this going to cost me anything ?"
"No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you ."
"When does the gym open and close ?"
"The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 ."
"Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ?"
"I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please ."
"Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ?"
"Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . "
"I guess you should know that you need to be hospitalized ."
"Of course I know ."
"Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures ."
"OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ?"
"It's hard to say . It depends on your recovery condition . But you need to stay for at least one day for observation ."
"Thank you , Doctor . I will go now . Bye-bye ."
"Bye ! "
"Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas ."
"Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ?"
"OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products ."
"That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising ."
"Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . "
"Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ?"
"This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ?"
"Hi , Ryan , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today ."
"What is wrong with you ?"
"I have really bad poison oak and can ’ t stop itching ."
"How long have you had it ?"
"I ’ Ve had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night ."
"How have you been treating it ?"
"I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine ."
"That should work . I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . "
"Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this !"
"What ? What ’ s the good news ?"
"My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September ."
"That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him ! "
"Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him ."
"Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet ."
"Sure , it ’ s 4-8- 7-2 . Don ’ t worry . You ’ re doing a fine job ."
"Thank you very much . Mr . Roberts . "
"Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat ."
"Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?"
"Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription ."
"Okay ."
"Goodbye , Randy . Take care . "
"OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits ."
"Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ?"
"For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB ."
"And how do I withdraw if I need to ?"
"You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account ."
"I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ?"
"With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . "
"May I help you ?"
"My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is ."
"What dose she look like ?"
"She has blond hair and blue eyes ."
"What was she wearing ?"
"She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers ."
"When did you last see her ?"
"I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... , How long has it been ?"
"Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . "
"Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again ."
"Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day ."
"Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ?"
"Sure , come with me . Hello , Michael , this is Steven . He will be part of your team ."
"Hi , Steven , welcome to join us !"
"I ’ Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance ."
"That ’ s right . Just call me if you need anything ."
"That's great ."
"Well , as the other guys are still not in , I ’ ll introduce you to them later ."
"All right . "
"What did you cook ?"
"Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes ."
"Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?"
"Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !"
"This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !"
"Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato ."
"This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !"
"Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !"
"Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !"
"Want some more ?"
"I'm stuffed ! "
"How would you describe your relationship with our boss ?"
"We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot ."
"What do you think his strengths are ?"
"Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . "
"Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers ."
"That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days ."
"When was it serviced ?"
"Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable ."
"What's actually wrong with it ?"
"Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays ."
"I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . "
"I don't know , but he gives me the creeps ."
"Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security ."
"But what if he knows my name , where I live ... , Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless ."
"Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo ."
"You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... , Now he's looking over here ! He's coming !"
"OK ! I'll call security . "
"All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ?"
"I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ?"
"Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ?"
"That ’ s right . I ’ ll be in the baggage area . "
"Hello , Doctor ."
"Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ?"
"It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining ."
"How long has this been going on ?"
"About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed ."
"How was your appetite ?"
"Pretty good , I'd say ."
"You haven't lost any weight , have you ?"
"No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds ."
"Unbutton your shirt , please ."
"Well , doctor ?"
"You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure ."
"What examinations ?"
"A blood test and during test . You can come back next week , say 4 pm to see the results . "
"Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ?"
"The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them !"
"I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ?"
"I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit ."
"Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest ."
"I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB ."
"That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB ."
"And for the Savings Deposit ?"
"For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more ."
"Wow ! A third more ? Very good . "
"What is the highest goal of your company ?"
"The supreme goal of ours is to be in the leadership in marketing ."
"Well , it is a really high target ."
"Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal . "
"Hi , did you call for an exterminator ?"
"Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy !"
"What sort of pest are we dealing with ?"
"We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !"
"Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu , No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! "
"do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?"
"yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ?"
"I was at home with my parents in New York City ."
"really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?"
"I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building ."
"that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?"
"no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos ."
"did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?"
"yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers ."
"did he survive ?"
"unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower ."
"I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family ."
"it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own ."
"terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . "
"Is English acceptable for you ?"
"Yes ."
"What's your name ?"
"Jenny Madison ."
"What ’ s your nationality ?"
"Nigerian ."
"What is your date of birth ?"
"15th of April , 1969 ."
"And your occupation ?"
"I am a painter ."
"What's your passport No . ?"
"7834623464 3367 ."
"Where do you live in China ?"
"In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing ."
"You are suspected of smuggling . Do you understand your rights ?"
"Yes ."
"Ok , sign here . "
"Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute ."
"Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ?"
"I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already ."
"I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . "
"I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ?"
"That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way ."
"We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me ."
"Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues ."
"I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees ."
"That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics ."
"Let's give it a shot ! "
"Would you mind if I ask your health status ?"
"I just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors ."
"That is good . We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy ."
"I understand that . "
"This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate ."
"Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card ."
"So it has attracted more and more customers these days ."
"Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . "
"Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview ."
"Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ?"
"Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period ."
"I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ?"
"Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question ."
"Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ?"
"Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period ."
"But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview ."
"I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company ."
"Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ?"
"Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ?"
"Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . "
"ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ?"
"I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here ."
"what ? I don't understand ."
"I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ?"
"Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' !"
"Huh ? What were you talking about , then ?"
"' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly !"
"oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! "
"I'm famished ! Let's get some grub !"
"I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa ."
"Me , too ! The chips here are so light and crispy ."
"And they have tangy , freshly-made salsa , too . My mouth is watering already !"
"I'll go get the chips . What do you want to drink ?"
"Surprise me . "
"Hello , Is this EYE computers ?"
"Yeas , It is . Sewen Jes speaking . How can I help ?"
"Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty ."
"Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ?"
"Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably ."
"Oh , dear ! I'll do whatever I can . "
"I would like to open an account today ."
"What kind ?"
"I want to open a checking account ."
"You need to keep a minimum balance ."
"How much is it ?"
"You need at least $ 100 in your account ."
"Is that all ?"
"Yes . That ’ s the minimum ."
"What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ?"
"You will get a fine ."
"How much ?"
"It ’ s going to be $ 25 . "
"Who is the next one ?"
"It's Peter's turn ."
"Give the mike to him ."
"OK ."
"Be quiet . He is singing ."
"I thought he only liked to listen !"
"So did I ."
"He has a really good voice !"
"Yes , he sings wonderfully . "
"Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ?"
"Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB ."
"Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars ."
"Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ?"
"Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations ."
"Here you go ."
"Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? "
"Hello , this is Francis ."
"Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report ."
"Today , I am busy all day long ."
"Shall I see you on Friday morning ?"
"That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time ."
"We must find some time to read report ."
"I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon ."
"That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon ."
"See you . "
"Would you like to travel ?"
"Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years ."
"How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ?"
"I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese ."
"That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ?"
"My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 ."
"We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ?"
"I think so ."
"Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way ."
"Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . "
"Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ?"

"Thanks . "
"Could you have a taxi pick me up and take me to the airport before 1 p . m . ?"
"What's your address , sir ?"
"I live at 323 Park Street ."
"Ok , someone will be there by 12:15 ."
"What are your rates ?"
"It's 2 dollars initially and 35 cents for each quarter mile ."
"I have four very large suitcases . Will those fit in the taxi ?"
"No , I'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up . "
"Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?"
"Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?"
"Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?"
"Yes , it will print immediately . "
"I am here to tell you that the clothes are very much to taste of our market and the customers are quite satisfied with the excellent quality ."
"We are very glad to hear that . We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country ."
"Well , we have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market . Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you ."
"We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ?"

"Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ?"
"Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing ’ s as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day ."
"I don ’ t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks . Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ?"
"Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ?"
"No , once I fill the tub with beer , I ’ ll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better ."
"I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It ’ s appetizing and tasty ."
"Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I ’ d rather die of thirst than drink champagne . "
"There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall ."
"Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ?"
"Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price ."
"Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday ."
"Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet ."
"Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that ."
"I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it ."
"See anything else we need there ?"
"Well , all shoes are 20 percent off ."
"Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes ."
"I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt ."
"Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . "
"You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays !"
"Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches !"
"You got it ! I ’ m going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii !"
"You are so lucky ! Send me a postcard ! "
"Good morning , Japan Airline domestic reservations . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I Would like make a reservation to Huston for tomorrow ."
"The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm . So you don't need a reservation . Seats are available on a ' first come , first served ' basis ."
"Oh , that's quite convenient . Thank you . "
"Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do ."
"Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ?"
"Oh yeah ! I'm a great rapper . And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart ."
"Excellent . I'll start practicing my dance moves . "
"Hello , this is Sunshine Trading Company . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment ."
"Great . Could you tell me something about cash control ?"
"Yes , of course . In accounting , cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank . "
"Where do you see yourself three years from now ?"
"Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm !"
"Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?"
"Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company ."
"Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?"
"Well , a working relationship . I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important . But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss . "
"That man's really a bore to me ."
"Which one do you mean ?"
"The man with his hair cropped . "
"Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview ."
"It's OK ."
"What did you do in the interview ?"
"I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine ."
"Are all these helpful for the interview ?"
"Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool ."
"Anything else ?"
"You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . "
"what are your strong points ?"
"well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient ."
"what kind of people do you like to work with ?"
"I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people ."
"what ’ s your greatest strength ?"
"well , this is a challenging question . I suppose I would say that I ’ m a quick learner ."
"so , you ’ re smart ."
"I think so . I think that I am good at what I do ."
"what do you consider your weakness ?"
"I ’ m not good at speaking in public . I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public ."
"that ’ s not a problem . It ’ s unnecessary for this position . "
"Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us ."
"Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us ."
"I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days ."
"I see.OK , that's agreed then . "
"Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days ."
"Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water ."
"Sounds a little weak ."
"Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee ."
"Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head ."
"Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . "
"... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ?"
"Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . "
"Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ?"
"Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks ."
"Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ?"
"No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway ."

"Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ?"
"It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . "
"Have you any tour route to Budapest ?"
"Yes , I have , sir . How long are you going on vacation ?"
"About 2 weeks ."
"I recommend you this route . We call it golden routes for the sightseeing spots ."

"Of course , we will , sir . "
"Hello . Holiday Inn . How can I help you ?"
"Yes . I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday . But I ’ m sorry to say that I have to cancel it . My wife is very sick now . I don ’ t think she ’ ll be able to travel by this Friday ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that ."
"Thank you . Can I cancel my reservation ?"
"Certainly . May I have your name , please ?"
"My name is Tom Smith ."
"Okay . I have canceled your reservation , Mr . Smith ."
"Thank you very much ."
"You ’ re welcome . I hope your wife is feeling better soon . "
"Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here ."
"Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA ."
"Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ?"
"OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food ."
"You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes ."
"Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! "
"Hello , what can I do for you ?"
"Hello , I come to pay my water and electricity fees ."
"Give me your water and electricity bills , please ."
"Here they are ."
"You should pay 160 yuan for the electricity fee and 80 yuan for the water fee ."
"Do you mean that I should pay 240 yuan in total ?"
"Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ?"
"Cash , please . Here is the money ."
"I get 250 yuan from you , and this is the change , 10 yuan ."
"OK . Thank you . Bye-bye ."
"Bye . "
"I need to know why I'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ."
"Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night ."
"Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert ."
"Well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . Let me correct this error , please ."
"Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly ."
"When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge ."
"Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ?"
"Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 ."
"Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ?"
"Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not . "
"Good morning . I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country ?"
"What do you want to go to US for ?"
"I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years ."
"Can I have a look at your letter of acceptance ?"
"Of course . Here you are ."
"That's OK . We'll contact you the moment we hear from home . "
"Good morning , may I help you ?"
"We'd like to take a tour to Florence ."
"That's a beautiful city . When do you want to go there ?"
"We have got a 2 weeks ' vocation and we plan to leave on Thursday ."
"Then please have a look at the table , there are so many plans . "
"Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ?"
"Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted ."
"So , is it actually paper at this stage ?"
"Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . "
"Hello , I want to make a reservation for a Qingdao cruise ."
"When will you set out ?"

"Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ?"

"Here are my coupons . Is that enough ?"
"You have to pay $ 0.5 more . "
"Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce ."
"You might want to try the mangoes ."
"Can you describe a mango to me ?"
"It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it ."
"Do I eat the seed ?"
"Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years ."
"What's the price of these mangoes ?"
"Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each ."
"Tell me what they taste like ."
"Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet ."
"Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ?"
"Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat ."
"Where do mangoes come from ?"
"These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . "
"Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ?"
"Uh , yes , they are ."
"Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ?"
"What ?"
"Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue !"
"Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience ."
"Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this !"
"Mike , don't even think about it ! "
"Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ?"
"OK . I just want to read the comics ."
"Take your time . "
"Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier ."
"Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three ."
"Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before ."
"When will we get one of those ?"
"You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . "
"Are you free next thursday ?"
"Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ?"
"A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement ."
"Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ?"
"Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young ."
"Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ?"
"Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? "
"How do you like the food here ?"
"I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best ."
"There are many things I miss . You can't get the ingredients here ."
"Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods ."
"Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . "
"Where can I get a good novel ?"
"There's a bookstore just across the street . "
"What are in this folder ?"
"They are reports of our company ."
"Are they filed alphabetically ?"
"No , they are filed according to dates ."
"Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?"
"No problem , here you are . "
"Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ?"
"I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much ."
"En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets ."
"Well , I understand ."
"Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . "
"Are you making what I think you're making ?"
"Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast ."
"What a nostalgic food !"
"Why the drama ? Have you been watching soap operas ?"
"No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... , Brings back memories ? "
"Where's the nearest bank ?"
"It's just around the corner "
"Boris , look at this sentence . "" Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . "" It's interesting , isn't it ?"
"I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those "" strict nutrition philosophies "" about ?"
"I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories ."
"Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists ."
"Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable ."
"Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food ."
"Seriously ?"
"Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so ."
"Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet ."
"Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine ."
"But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body . "
"Who wants to go first ? Lily ?"
"Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?"
"OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys !"
"How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke !"
"I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! "
"John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job ."
"Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users ."
"Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best ."
"I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office ."
"Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize ."
"I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time ."
"Come on ! What are you nervous about ?"
"It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation ."
"But the sale number is close to the predicted amount ."
"I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place ."
"Take it easy . Be confident . I'm sure you can do it . "
"Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ?"
"Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number ."
"Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ?"
"It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ?"
"The accounts department , I think ."
"The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I'm looking for the cameras ."
"They're in Aisle Two . "
"Hey , Jack , I'd better go now ."
"Is your boss coming by ?"
"Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m ."
"Okay . Get back to your work , and call me back this evening ."
"Okay , no problem . Bye !"
"Bye ! "
"I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ?"
"Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract ."
"I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation ."
"I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us ."
"All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ?"
"I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country ."
"It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties ."
"Ok . "
"How nice these sunglasses are !"
"Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ?"
"I want to try on this pair ."
"The round shape pair ?"
"That's right ."
"I think it suits you well ."
"I agree , how much ?"
"120 yuan ."
"It's not expensive . OK . I'll take them . "
"I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please ."
"Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ?"
"No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today ."
"Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today ."
"Would you please ask when he will be free ?"
"Have a seat please while I call . "
"Hi , Bob ."
"How did you do on your driving test ?"
"Passed ."
"That's great and it was your first try . "
"I know that you are interested in our washers ."
"Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery ."
"We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers ."
"We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ?"
"Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else . Here are our latest price lists . You will see that our prices are very attractive ."
"Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ?"
"Sure , we do ."
"How long does it usually take you to make delivery ?"
"As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months ."
"Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis ."
"Okay . No problem . "
"How much is it ?"
"6 500 yuan . You will get it on the price tag ."
"It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ?"
"Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan ."
"I ’ d buy this if it were cheaper . How about 5 000 yuan ?"
"Hum ... I say 5 500 yuan . That's as cheap as it can get ."
"Is it the final price ?"
"I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price ."
"Alright , I ’ ll buy this one . "
"Are you ready to order , sir ?"
"Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ?"
"Of course . Here you are ."
"Then , what's special tonight ?"
"Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic ."
"All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables . "

"I ’ d be glad to . Just leave them on my desk . I didn ’ t expect you to finish so soon ."
"Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon ."
"Great . Good work . "
"I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet ."
"You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy ."
"You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat ."
"More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down ."
"You said it . "
"May I speak to Mr . Thomas ?"
"Unfortunately , he has left for the day ."
"I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him , I ’ ll make sure he gets the message . "
"May I have the menu , please ?"
"Oh . I am sorry , here you are . May I suggest our lunch special ?"
"Could I have a few more minutes ?"
"Of course . I will be here minutes later . "
"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something ."
"I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files !"
"But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus ."
"Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems ."
"Ok . Anything else ?"
"Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !"
"Um yeah.Sorry about that . "
"I want to reserve a VIP room at 7:00 this evening ."
"OK , sir . How many people are there in your party ?"
"8 . Is your VIP room big enough for 8 persons ?"
"Of course . "
"May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere ."
"It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . "
"Do you have any experience working with a computer ?"
"Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years ."
"What kind of software can you use ?"
"I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos . Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages ."
"Do you have any other computer qualifications ?"
"Yes , I have an ACRE certificate , Bank 2 ."
"Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information ?"
"I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information , but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly . It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . "
"Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ?"
"Yes , it is . What can I do for you ?"
"I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission ."
"Are they urgent , please ?"
"Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days ."
"Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days ."

"Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them ."
"All right . Here you are ."
"This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt ."
"Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . "
"Jodi , I must get a hold of Jim today , but I forgot his address and phone number ."
"Don ’ t worry about it . I have his pager number right here ."
"Really ? You ’ Ve helped me a lot . Thank you ."
"Forget it . It ’ s nothing . "
"I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson ."
"OK , please be seated . May I have your name , please ?"
"My name is Woody ."
"OK , Woody . Why are you interested in this job ?"
"Because I admire your company . Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city ."
"Have you worked anywhere else before ?"
"Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman ."
"OK , your work experience is impressive , and I think you sound right for this position , but I do have 3 other people to interview , so you'll be hearing from us within a week ."
"Thanks . "
"How about this opera given by the famous musician ?"
"Fair to middling . A little hard to appreciate . "
"Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ?"
"You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it ."
"OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time ."
"I see . What's the interest like on those ?"
"There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % ."
"Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! "
"Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening ."
"You're welcome ."

"Don't worry about that.We have experience . "
"May I ask you a few questions about insurance ?"
"Yes ."
"Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ?"
"Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover ."
"Why not ?"
"Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough ."
"Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average ."
"That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases ."
"Are there any other clauses in marine policies ?"
"Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC ."
"Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ?"
"Are you going to make an offer today ?"
"Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates ."

"Really ? I ’ ll take it then . "
"I need help finding a gift for my daughter ."
"Would she like a laptop ?"
"That sounds like a good idea ."
"A Mac is a very popular brand ."
"She mentioned a Mac . How much is it ?"
"A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2,100 plus tax ."
"That sounds like a great price . I'll take one ."
"This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ?"
"I'll use my VISA ."
"We're almost through . Just sign here , please ."
"Just take it home and plug it in ?"
"She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box ."
"She's going to be so pleased with this ."
"Remember us for all your computer needs . "
"Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ?"
"Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago ."

"Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes ?"
"Just say the word , sir ."
"Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun ."
"I agree . The dew is still on the grass ."
"I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage ."
"We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit ."
"Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ?"
"Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit ."
"Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second ."
"Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away . "
"Hi , waiting for the bus ? Where are you going ?"
"China Hotel ."

"Before 12 a . m ."
"I see . Thank you . "
"May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?"
"Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point ."
"Thank you for telling me that ."
"But remind you , there are some forbidden activities ."
"What are they ? I ’ ll be careful ."
"Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters ."
"I got it ."
"Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed ."
"I see . "
"Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit !"
"Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... , Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does ."
"Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today ."
"No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ?"
"Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me ."
"Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ?"
"Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house ."
"Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'm looking for Bob ."
"He's in a meeting with Phil ."
"No problem , I can wait . "
"Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ?"
"Yes , Ms . Ross ? What do you need ?"
"I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation . I want to enter a Master ’ s program in marketing . It ’ s all on weekends and evenings ."
"Good news ! I ’ ll be glad to . When do you need it ? "
"Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ?"
"Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house ."
"Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps ."
"I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well ."
"Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !"
"Do I have to pay an installation fee ?"
"Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !"
"Awesome ! "
"Mr . Crane ’ s office . Sandy speaking . May I help you ?"
"Hi , Sandy . It ’ s Walter Knight . I need to book some time with Mr . Crane ."
"Certainly , Mr . Knight . When would you like to meet with him ?"

"Tell me about yourself and your past experience ."
"For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member ."
"Why are you interested in this occupation ?"
"It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places ."
"What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ?"
"Well , a stewardess should be friendly , courteous , patient and treat passengers kindly and politely ."
"Do you get angry easily ?"
"No , I know how to control my temper ."
"If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ?"
"I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time ."
"If you are hired , when can you start work ?"
"I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works . "
"I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ?"
"For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 ."
"That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ?"
"Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ?"
"Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ?"
"For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 ."
"So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might , We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ?"
"I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . "
"I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank ."
"That's no problem at all , but could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID ."
"Here you go . Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in ?"
"Yes , there needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account . Also , you will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account ."
"OK , how long does it need to be ? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers ."
"Just 6 digits . "
"Hello , so how are we feeling today ?"
"Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith ."
"Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ?"
"Yes , I am applying for new health insurance , and I need a physical examination to qualify ."
"Your basic physical exam will include lungs , heart , blood levels , and eyes , ears , and nose ."
"I ’ Ve been having a little trouble breathing . Would you look into that , please ?"
"We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test ."
"I would appreciate it . When you give me a blood test , what are you looking for ?"
"I am going to check your cholesterol , blood sugar , and white blood cell count ."
"I am expecting the tests to go well . I have been taking good care of myself . "

"That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ?"
"I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . "
"Can you show me some jade , please ?"
"Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ?"
"No , but I do like jade bracelets ."
"Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please ."
"Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?"
"Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds ."
"I wonder which looks more lustrous ."
"Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful ."
"Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . "
"I hope we could offer the most favorable terms ."
"I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices ."
"Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents ."
"As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission ."

"Yes , they have been concerned about me finding a job ."
"What do they say ?"
"They want to recommend some jobs to me ."
"Really ? What jobs are they ?"
"My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company ."
"It's great !"
"My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now , and she wants me to give it a try ."
"This is a good opportunity ."
"One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview ."
"You can give it a try ! May be you will succeed ."
"I know . Let me think it over ."
"If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me !"

"But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ?"
"Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick ."
"What would happen if they started attacking you ?"
"You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive ."
"I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ?"
"It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food ."

"Well , then , how much do I owe you ?"
"That comes to H . K . $ 120 . "
"Mm , they taste delicious . Let's settle the bill ."
"Yes . Let's go Dutch ."
"No . It's on me this time ."
"You are always so hospitable . "
"Have you a garment ?"
"Yes , what style do you prefer ?"
"Show me the black one , my size ."
"OK , here you are ."
"Well , I don't think it matches my jeans.Can you give me some advice ? "
"Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well ."
"Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package , too ."
"Great . How much is this going to cost ?"
"Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ?"
"What ’ s the difference ?"
"Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online ."

"I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?"
"Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?"
"How about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them ."
"Dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !"
"Well , what do you have in mind ?"
"How about the Mongolian hot pot ?"
"Oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up !"
"Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base ."
"Sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well ."
"Yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines ."
"Great . Let's go !"
"Wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . "
"What kind of films do you like best ?"
"I like feature films best . How about you ?"
"I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ?"
"I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot ."
"You are sort of romantic . "
"Excuse me . What's the time difference between Beijing and San Francisco ?"
"16 hours . Beijing is 16 hours ahead ."
"Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America ?"
"We are gaining a day ."
"So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ?"
"That's right . "
"Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?"
"Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class ."
"You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run some errands ."
"Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have someone to help me out , though ."
"I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids ."
"Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while . "
"Have you had enough time to look over the menu ?"
"Yes , we are almost ready to order ."
"Let me remind you of the specials of the day , which are posted on the board ."
"Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ?"
"Yes , we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs ."
"I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices ."
"Yes , the roasted vegetable salad is good , and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice ."
"I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles , please ."
"That is an excellent choice , and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner ."
"Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry ! "
"Mr Edgar , hello ! How's business ? Still booming ? What can we do for you today ?"
"Well , I'm here to get some help from you . I was hoping to have someone who we can deal with exclusively . On a long-term basis , if that's possible ."
"What we can do is to assign you a customer manager , that way you can just deal with him . You don't need to deal with anyone else ."
"That sounds perfect . "
"Here's the picture of my family ."
"Can you point out your mother for me ?"
"OK.She ' s near-sighted , with a pair of glasses on her nose.She is the only one wearing glasses in my family . "
"What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?"
"I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak ."
"Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !"
"What ’ s wrong ?"
"I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me !"
"Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor ."
"Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !"
"Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . "
"Thank you for your visit to our company . I'd like to make an introduction for you . Is there anything in particular you'd like to know ?"
"Your company has a very good reputation , and I have been planning to visit it for a long time . What's the advantage of your factory over other plastics ones ?"
"Our production speed is almost twice the industry-wide average . And we've already expanded the factory this year ."
"Could you tell me the cost of production per unit ?"
"I'm not familiar with that part . Let me call someone in charge . "
"Mr . Smith , how was your flight ?"
"Rather nice ."
"What was the weather like in New York ?"

"25.00 dollars a week , but you can't have visitors ."
"Fine.Would it be OK to look at the room ?"
"Could you come back later ? We ’ re right in the middle of dinner . "
"When the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief ."
"Still , you should not let down your guard . Some details should be paid attention to ."
"At this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview ."
"You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today ."
"Don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply ."
"And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary ."
"You should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently ."
"You can ask questions about the position you are applying for ."
"In this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get ."
"Of course ."
"Just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave ."
"Besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an E-mail or a call . "
"Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days ."
"No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package ."

"Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ?"
"I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please ."
"It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement ."
"I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ?"
"We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with ."
"That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ?"
"Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee ."
"That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . "
"I ’ d like to make a collect call to Beijing China , please ."
"What ’ s the number you are calling , please ?"
"The number I am calling is 86-10- 4016-9988 , What ’ s the name of the person you are calling ?"

And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath ."
"Yes , I see . Thanks a lot . "
"Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ?"
"Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent ."
"Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?"
"No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before ."
"It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?"
"A company account . I need to pay a bill ."
"Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number ."

"It ’ s my pleasure . "
"If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ ."
"That's right . Let's go into the details ."
"Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales ."
"Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ?"
"But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 ."
"Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment ."
"I hope you'll try to get them to step up production ."
"As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production ."
"If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said ."
"I am sorry ."
"What's your last word as to the date then ?"
"I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise ."
"All right . I'll take you at your word ."
"Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep ."
"I promise . "
"If we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ?"
"I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month ."
"I think your background and experience are worth the compensation ."
"Does it include bonuses ?"
"No , there are annual bonuses , one week paid vacation a year , and health insurance ."
"Very good . "
"Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing ."
"We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done ."
"Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ?"
"We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse ."
"Wonderful . "
"Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU ."
"Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars ."
"It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously ."
"If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount ."
"Well , can you explain it to me ?"
"The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units ."
"Can you reduce more ?"
"I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price ."
"In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider ."
"It is so hard to deal with ."
"If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot ."
"This price is the best we can make . "
"How's the building work going ?"
"Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay ."
"What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget ."
"The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again ."
"OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . "
"I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these ."
"There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve ."
"Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off ."
"Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . "
"What companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ?"
"Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short ."
"What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ?"
"I wish to work in the planning department ."
"What type of work will you expect to do at first ?"
"I expect to operate computers ."
"What are your plans for the future ?"
"I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future ."
"How long does it take to get here from your home ?"
"It's a twenty-minute bus ride ."
"How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ?"
"I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to ."
"You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ?"
"I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work ."
"Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ?"
"I think so ."
"What ideas do you have if we employ you ?"
"Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy ."
"Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?"
"No , nothing in particular ."
"If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ?"
"I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized ."
"If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ?"
"I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail ."
"What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ?"
"People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for ."
"What are your expectations from working on this job ?"
"Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing ."
"If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ?"
"I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher ."
"If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ?"
"I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . "
"We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?"
"That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ?"
"See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too ."
"Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies ."
"The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is ."
"Do you enjoy working in this office ?"
"Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer ."
"What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ?"
"We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English ."

"My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ?"
"I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please ."
"Thank you , Miss Kelly ."
"What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?"
"I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute ."
"Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?"
"Yes , I would ."
"( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ?"
"Yes , I'd like to give it a try ."
"All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . "
"Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ?"
"Let me run and check . "
"Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you !"
"What is that ?"
"A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play !"
"Cool !"
"Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally ."
"What about all these other pieces ?"
"See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it ."
"And these two ? They are husband and wife ?"
"That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?"
"Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! "
"Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon ."
"Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . "
"Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?"
"Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today ."
"OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ?"
"Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ?"
"You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode ."
"Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please ."
"Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees ."
"OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . "
"Excuse me , sir ? I just need a little bit more information . Could you tell me your telephone number and mailing address ?"
"Sure . My number is 545-8897 , and I live at 908 Mulbury Street ."
"That ’ s 545-8897 and your mailing address is 908 Mulbury Street . The zip code is 20310 , right ?"
"That ’ s right . "
"Excuse me , Ms . Montgomery ?"
"I ’ m sorry , Jeff . Please don ’ t interrupt me right now . I ’ m in the middle of a conversation ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later ."
"That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be finished in a little while . "
"Are you feeling OK ?"
"My stomach is bothering me ."
"What have you been eating ?"
"I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch ."
"Maybe the food had something wrong with it ."
"It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either ."
"Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ?"
"I haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual ."
"Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around ."
"I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu . "
"What are you doing ?"
"I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay ."
"You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd !"
"Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy ."
"I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ?"
"Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy ."
"Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ?"
"You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything ."
"Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online ?"

"Have you decided ?"
"Yes , I want to get a better job ."

"At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials ."
"I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it ."
"I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 ."

"Sure . It's 2331-7600 ."
"And your address ?"
"2244 Forest Drive . "
"Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background ."
"I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used ."
"What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?"
"Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input ."
"Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?"
"There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort ."
"Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome ."
"I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done ."
"What are your strengths and weaknesses ?"
"My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more ."
"Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss ."
"I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day ."
"When do you find a job satisfying ?"
"My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner ."
"How would your coworkers describe you ?"
"First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously ."
"Do you have any questions ?"
"Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? "
"Where do you want to go ?"
"I am going to the Capital Hotel ."
"Get in . I will take you there ."
"About how much it will cost ?"
"$ 50 ."
"On the meter ?"
"Ye , of course ."
"OK.let ' s go . "
"I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ?"
"That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores ."
"Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ?"
"Yes , I liked math in school ."
"We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ?"
"Yes , I enjoy working with people ."
"We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ?"
"Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ?"
"Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ?"
"No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn ."
"That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . "
"Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too ."
"Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ?"
"No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon ."
"How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ?"
"He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend . "
"What do we need for the barbecue ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties ."
"I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ?"
"I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up !"
"And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers ."
"They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes ."
"I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce ."
"I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop ."
"How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ?"
"It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked ."
"They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it ."
"I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! "
"How would you describe your ideal job ?"
"I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement ."
"Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?"
"I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field ."
"What makes you think you would be a success in this position ?"
"My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful ."
"How do you know about this company ?"
"Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . "
"Why are you leaving your present job ?"
"I ’ m not so satisfied with it ."
"Why do you plan to change your job ?"
"I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job ."
"Why are you interested in working with this company ?"
"One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for "
"Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks ."
"This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . "
"Excuse me , driver , where is the main area for restaurants ?"
"It's near the Wall Street , a bit far from there . Why not get on the car , OK . Is there a Chinese restaurant ?"
"Of course . More than that , you have Italy pizza , English steak , kimchi and local specialties ."
"Woo , I can't help being there . "

"Laptops are more expensive , right ?"
"Yes , they generally cost a little more ."
"I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me . "
"Why didn't you sign the contract ?"
"Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law . "
"Hong , I really need to call back to the UK but I can ’ t afford to pay for the roaming charges ."

"Can I do that ?"
"Yes . Just go to the convenience store and ask for a SIM card . Then insert it into your phone ."
"I see . How much will that cost ?"
"Well it ’ s 100 RIB for the SIM card then it will cost you about 10 RIB per minute to call the UK ."
"Wow , that is cheap . Thank you very much . "
"Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ?"
"No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while ."
"Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up ."
"We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ?"
"Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now ."
"Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?"
"I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately ."
"She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon ."

"How did I do ?"
"Not so good . Lots of complains ."
"Really ? I thought I was doing well ."
"Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . "
"Hi Mike . What have you been up to ?"
"Not much . I started exercising ."
"Trying to get in shape ?"
"Yeah , and I need to start improving my health ."
"Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ?"
"That's about all ."
"I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously ."
"Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems ."
"Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy ."
"True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . "
"I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ?"

"How much do you pay wholesale for your products ?"
"We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % ."
"That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ?"
"Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price ."

"buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses ."
"like what ?"
"well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way ."
"that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?"
"sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it ."
"is the house pretty run-down ."
"not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her ."
"was it very old house ?"
"it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time ."

"the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . "

"You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off ."

"No , some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment ."
"How can I find out if I can collect ?"
"Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect ."
"How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment ?"
"It depends on how much you earned . When you file , they will determine the amount . "
"You look tired ."
"Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately ."
"Really ? How come ?"
"My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult !"
"You shouldn ’ t work so hard ."
"I know . But hard work pays off , you know ."

"I see . And the other alternatives ?"
"Alternatively , we do offer wireless in our lobby . You can bring your laptop down here ."
"Great ! What if I need to print something in the lobby ?"
"You would have to use the computer lab . I'm sorry for the inconvenience . "
"What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ?"
"Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking ."
"What did you do to put it into practice ?"
"I divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . It can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students . "
"Hello sir , may I help you ?"
"Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet ."
"I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers ."
"Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range ."

"Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat ."
"No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?"
"Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like ."
"Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?"
"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered ."
"What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste ."
"Don ’ t worry . We ’ ll just get a doggie bag . "
"What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ?"
"You should wear a formal dress and be confident ."

"Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . "
"You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation ."
"Let me try . It has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... Egypt ?"
"How in the world did you guess that ? Did someone tell you already ?"
"Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store ."
"I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids !"
"I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours ."
"It helps that my dad is an archaeologist ."
"We'll get to go fishing at the river . I hate fish . "
"Hello . I would like to make a reservation at 8: 00 ."
"OK , sir . How many are coming ?"
"4 . By the way , what's your dress code ?"
"We require a jacket and tie ."
"I see . Thank you . "
"Let me ask some questions . Do you know what people need to get entry into China ?"
"Yes . An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China ."
"What materials do they need in order to apply the passport ?"
"They should fill in an application form , hand in the copies of Identification Card and household register . "
"Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?"
"It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive ."
"We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams ."
"Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around ."
"That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus ."
"Really ? I think you see more traveling by train ."
"So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ?"
"I prefer going by train , ever though it costs more ."
"Ok them . We ’ ll go by train . I ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey . Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?"
"The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles ."
"We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . "
"From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job ."

We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust ."
"But it's the style now ."
"I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want ."
"Of course ."
"Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself ."
"Why is that ?"
"Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work ."
"Oh , I see ."
"We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively ."
"What happened to her ?"
"Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends ."
"I see . "
"Could you give me a taxi to pick me up and take me to the airport before 1:00 p . m . ?"

"I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel ."
"OK , someone will be there by 12:15 . "
"Tell me something about your work experience ."
"Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design ."
"What systems have you worked on ?"
"I have worked on about every system that is out right now ."
"Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ?"
"I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems . But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time ."
"What do you consider your strengths ?"
"I am knowledgeable and levelheaded . "
"Jane , the meeting is scheduled from 1:00 this afternoon . Have you made the necessary arrangements ?"
"Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting ."
"That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ?"
"In the dining room . It's spacious there ."
"We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting ."
"I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English ."

"Oh , cash will be fine ."
"Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us . "
"Come in , please ."
"Good afternoon , Mrs Smith ."

"Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in ."

"Interpersonal and technical skills ."

"Anything else ?"
"No ."
"Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye ."
"Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . "
"I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ?"
"Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average ."
"So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ?"
"That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . "
"Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer ."
"You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now ."
"Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market !"
"Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller ."
"It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt ."
"Do you think it's that serious ?"
"Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep ."
"My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . "
"The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers ."
"I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand ."
"Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ?"
"How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready ."
"Sounds like a good idea ."
"We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug ."
"I agree with your proposal . "
"Why are you handing me a plastic cup ?"
"Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample ."
"How am I supposed to do that ?"
"We need you to urinate like you normally would , and then stop and finish into the cup ."
"What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done ?"
"Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away ."
"What kind of test is this ?"
"He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine , which could signal an infection ."
"How long will it take to get the results ?"
"We will send your doctor the results , and he will contact you . "
"Hello . I need to disconnect my phone , please ."
"All right . Where do you live , sir ?"
"At 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City ."
"Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ?"
"I ’ m moving to a new home ."
"O . K . May I have your name please ?"
"John Smith ."

"Thank you , Mr . Smith . Your phone will be disconnected after this phone call . Have a nice day ."
"Thank you , you too . "
"As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ?"
"Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage ."
"And we should have good sitting posture ."
"That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer ."
"Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ?"
"Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work ."
"I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular ."
"Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there ."
"I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do ."
"As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . "
"Good day to you . How can I be of service today ?"
"Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account ."
"I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from , Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ?"
"Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ?"
"Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . "
"Okay , I want to change 22,000 ."
"Could you please fill out this form ?"
"Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . ) , Here's your $ 200 ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Thank you . "
"Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ?"
"Of course , Mr . Green ."
"Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon ."
"No problem . I will do it immediately ."
"Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily ."
"OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ?"
"Please type it in a formal style ."
"I see . Anything else ?"
"No , thanks . "
"Mister , I have an account now ."
"Now , how would you like this check cashed , madam ?"
"Six tens will be fine ."
"Here you are ."
"Thanks . Er , mister , if I want to deposit checks next time . what should I do ?"
"Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours . That's from 9 a . m . to 3 p . m . "
"Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ?"
"You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours ."
"It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills ."
"Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe , What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again ."

"Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?"
"Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns ."
"We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs ."
"Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot ."
"Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers ."
"This is gonna be a great barbecue ! "
"In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation ."
"I'm not sure if that would be wise ."
"Then what is your opinion ?"
"Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . "
"Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ?"
"Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C ."
"No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ?"
"I have , but I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them ?"
"Of course , that's all part of the service ."
"Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... , Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ?"
"That's fine . Thank you again . "
"Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses ."
"Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ?"
"Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?"
"Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever ."
"So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ?"
"Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon ."
"Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ?"
"Yes , please . "
"Lisa , can I call Taiwan ?"
"Are you homesick ?"
"I miss my parents ."
"Don't worry about the bill . Just call ."

"Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code , That's 886 ."
"Now you should know the rest . Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code . "
"Do you have any vacancies ?"
"Yes , we have a nice room on the sixth floor ."
"How much is it ?"
"200 yuan a night ."
"OK . Dose it include breakfast ?"
"Yes . And could I have your name ?"
"Kate Green ."
"How long do you want to stay ?"
"5 days . And could you send a bellboy to pick up my luggage ?"
"Sure . We'll be there in a few minutes ."
"Could you keep my valuables ?"
"We'd like to . You may call the attendant if you need any help . "
"Thomas , could you do me a favor ?"
"What's up ?"
"Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ?"
"Why don't you go ?"
"I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him ."
"I see . I'll do it for you ."
"Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you . "

"Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T ."
"Cygnet . OK , I've got that . "
"Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?"
"Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes ."
"It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture ."
"You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler ."
"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !"
"It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards ."
"What for ? "
"We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs . We have separate areas for welding , grinding and sawing ."
"Is there anything you don't do in-house ?"
"Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance ."

"It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . "
"Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ?"
"I'd like to look it over before I sign it ."
"OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms ."

"Shall we sign this contract now ?"
"OK . Where do you want me to sign ?"
"Just sign at the bottom ."
"OK . ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed , it has legal effect ."
"You're right . Thank you for your cooperation ."
"It's my pleasure . "
"Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know ."
"But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us ."
"Is what you said really true ?"
"Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth ."
"Thank you . "
"Did you working in a similar position before ?"
"Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer ."
"Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ?"
"Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation ."
"If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?"
"I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility ."
"Are you able to operate the telex ?"
"Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information ."
"Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ?"
"When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good ."
"If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently ."
"No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . "
"Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ?"
"Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ?"
"Yes , we can do that . We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents . They all need to be in duplicate ."
"Yes , I've got all that here ."
"Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ?"
"A copy or the original ? I guess you need the original , right ? OK , I'll return shortly . "
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed ."
"What ? You've got to be kidding me !"
"I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week ."
"Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner ."
"Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional ."
"I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ?"
"Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring , I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction ."
"That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . "
"Good morning . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment downtown ."
"Certainly , sir . How much rent did you want to pay ?"
"Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 520 a month ."
"$ 520 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that.We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ’ s near the station ."
"Is it furnished ?"
"No . it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but no oven.There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it.The landlord lives downstairs.Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 , No , thank you ! I want an apartment , not a prison . "
"Is this Mr David Richton ?"
"Yes ."
"Hello , Mr David Richton , this is Min Wang calling from network , i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet ."
"Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview ."
"That is wonderful . "
"This is the last of the milk ."
"I know . I intent to go to the store today ."
"Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV ."
"Which one ?"
"You know . The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down ."
"Oh , you mean kikois ."
"Yeah , That ’ s the one ."
"Well . I ’ ll see , sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal . "
"Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted.Have you ever seen such a nice house ?"
"Not really ."
"This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new ."
"It's great ! "
"I need order in the court !"
"I am ready to make my plea ."
"What do you plead ?"
"I plead not guilty ."
"All the evidence indicates that you are guilty ."
"I realize that , but I am not guilty ."
"Is that right ?"
"I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed ."
"Who is the guilty party ?"
"I ’ ll tell you if you let me go ."
"I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you ."
"I am willing to tell you that information . "
"this bloody computer !"
"what seems to be the problem ?"
"my computer just crashed again for the third time today !"
"what were you doing when it crashed ?"
"i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery ."
"I think that might have been a virus ."
"oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange ."
"what kind of computer do you have , a Mac or a PC ?"
"it's a PC . doesn't everyone have a PC in this office ?"
"no , some people have Macs now , too ."
"what's the difference ?"
"PCs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac ."
"I didn't know that ."
"has your computer turned back on yet ?"
"yes ."
"did you end up losing any of your work ?"
"fortunately , I saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be OK ."
"you should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for virus ."
"that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help ! "
"Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look ."
"What is it ?"

"Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ?"
"Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there ."
"OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move ."
"How much will it cost in that case ?"
"Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please ."
"Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving ."
"No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving ."
"The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ?"
"OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department . "
"How about your present pay ?"
"Basically I get 5,000 RIB every month . It is a well-paid job with satisfying working hours ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"I require 6,500 RIB per month as a start . This is my bottom line , the minimum salary I can accept . "
"This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here ."
"You look a little lost , can I help you ?"
"Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something ."
"Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties . Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it ."
"Sure that ’ s fine ."
"This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ?"
"Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ?"
"Just pick something and get the hell out of here . Um , I'll go with these two . This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with . She better thank me for this ... , Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them ."
"Finally !"
"I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . "
"What is your case against the police ?"
"They arrested me for nothing ."
"What do you mean ?"
"They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me ."
"Didn ’ t they let you go ?"
"They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning ."
"So they kept you at the station ?"
"They sure did ."
"Did they tell you why they arrested you ?"
"I matched the description of a robbery suspect ."
"I understand ."
"I want to take them to court . "
"I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these ."
"There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve ."
"Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off ."
"Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . "
"I decided to give it a go !"
"Good for you . What items did you bid on ?"
"A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !"
"Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !"
"Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !"
"That's not how this game works ."
"Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ” , How many bids had been placed before you ? "
"There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide ."
"You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds ."
"But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it ."
"To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . "
"What can I do for you , Ma'am ?"
"I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter ."
"How old is she ?"
"She is 17 . It's for her birthday ."
"We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls . The brand name is Nokia ."
"Thanks , but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products ."
"Sure . This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend . Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable ."
"Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ?"
"Sure . By the way , here are some free adornments . Would you like one ?"
"Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one ."
"Have a seat over there . I'll pack it up for you right away ."
"Thanks . "
"I don't make idle threats ."
"I guess not ."
"I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave ."
"Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much ."
"If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail ."
"What are you trying to say ?"
"I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? "
"Honey , can you set the table ?"
"Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ?"
"Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case ."
"Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ?"
"Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well ."
"I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner ."
"Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ?"
"They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there ."
"Oops ! "
"Are you being served , sir ?"
"I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room ."
"Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ?"
"These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ?"
"Yes , sir ."
"How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ?"
"Ninety dollars ."
"It's too expensive ."
"But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more ."
"You're right . Would you please show me some embroidery ? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry ."
"Please wait a minute , sir . "
"Good morning . May I help you , sir ?"
"Yes . I want to make a remittance to New Delhi ."
"Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ?"
"I'd like a banker's draft please . It's not really urgent . "
"Could you show me where the ice cream is located ?"
"Just go to the end of the store . And it will be on your right . We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers ."
"This is my first time here ."
"Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you ."
"I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables ."
"That ’ s correct . "
"ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ?"
"Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ?"
"Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ?"
"No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information ."
"It is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly ."
"The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . "
"Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ?"
"We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents ."
"I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ?"
"I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit ."
"To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost ."
"Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum ."
"Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me ."
"Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports ."
"To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ?"
"I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . "
"what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ?"
"I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions ."
"homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ?"
"I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry ."
"that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ?"
"almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash ."
"it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now ."
"the cost of living in London is just too high for most people ."
"it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment ."
"did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ?"
"there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble ."
"added to that is the high unemployment rate right now ."
"something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon ."
"politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class ."
"I can only hope that one day they will change . "
"Could I have my hair dyed ?"
"Certainly , which color do you want to dye it ?"
"I want the latest fashion , can you make some suggestions ?"
"Right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond ."
"I don't think that was suit me very well , blond is kind of erratic ."
"What do you think about pink ?"
"Oh , no . I think it's better to be a natural chinese , with natural chinese hair.Have you got good brand of hair dye ?"
"Yes , we have several brands , which one do you prefer ?"
"I want the best one ."
"First , you need a shampoo , it makes it easier for your hair to be dyed . Let's down your hair in the water , you hair will be fairly clean that way ."
"After this dye job , it feels I look younger ."
"You hair is definitely fresh and shiner looking . "
"Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ?"
"Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract ."
"I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China ."
"Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country ."
"I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ?"
"Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . "
"What are your terms of payment ?"
"Our terms are net 30 ."
"What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ?"
"You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible ."
"We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units ."
"An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . "
"Hi , I was wondering if you have my test results in ."
"I didn ’ t see anything out of the ordinary , but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details ."
"So , basically , I am OK ?"
"If there were any major problems , I would always notify you by phone to come in ."
"What will I learn when I see the results on the website ?"
"A description of each test is given on the site ."
"What will the numbers tell me ?"
"The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are ."
"Are all of my test results on that site ?"
"Your entire test history is on the site . You can compare your results from other years . "
"Mr . Tang , we have decided to hire you . How much do you expect to get a month ?"
"I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ?"
"I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary ."
"You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience ."
"Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here ."
"What are they ?"
"Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car ."
"But I have my own car and my own house ."
"OK , 4000 yuan a month ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Not at all , it's reasonable . "
"A table for two , please ."
"All right . How about this one by the window ?"
"Thank you . It's fine ."
"May I take your order now , sir ?"
"What do you recommend ? We'd like some of your local specialities ."
"Our restaurant is famous for its seafood ."
"One cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns ."
"Shrimp salad is our speciality , took , No , I think it's enough ."
"What would you like to drink ?"
"A juice and a coke . "
"Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank ."
"Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right ."
"Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance ."
"I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ?"
"Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see ."
"That's no problem . Could you please sign here ? Here's the 1,000 RIB in cash , your passport back , and the remaining balance has been deposited in your account . "
"I need to open an account ."
"Do you know what kind you want to open ?"
"I want a checking account ."
"Do you know what the minimum balance is ?"
"What is that ?"
"You need to keep it at $ 100 ."
"That ’ s it ?"
"That ’ s the least amount you can have ."
"What ’ ll happen if I don ’ t maintain that ?"
"We will fine you ."
"How much will I be fined ?"
"You will be fined $ 25 . "
"Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ?"
"Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ?"
"Sure . Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week ."
"Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity ."
"Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address ."
"Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now ."
"You ’ re welcome . Bye . "
"Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY !"
"What !"
"Wow ! What's that ?"
"It's my new radio earphone ."
"It's so small that I didn't notice it ."
"What were you screaming at me for ? "
"Excuse me , do you have any English songs ?"
"Yes , we do . They are all in this book ."
"Great , thanks ."
"No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers !"
"Oh , I see . "
"Well , that was an interesting documentary !"
"For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US ."
"Like what ?"
"Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ?"
"Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg ."
"That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that ."
"That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?"
"Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank ."
"I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! "
"What experience do you have with office machinery ?"
"I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor . By the way , I took a computer course in university ."
"Where do you want to be in five years ?"
"I want to be a manager ."
"Very good . Any questions ?"
"Nothing . I think I'll take the job . "
"I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price ."
"I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment ."
"I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now ."
"Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer ."
"Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon ."
"Sure , no problem . "
"I need some more amenities , please ."
"I'm not sure I'm following you , sir ."
"Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo ."
"Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ?"
"No , I'm not even halfway through my supply ."
"I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ?"
"What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ?"
"Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs !"
"There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs ."
"Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items ."
"I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and I don't intend to start now ."
"Sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily . "
"Hello . Overseas operator . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to make a collect call to Japan ."
"Your name , please ?"
"It's Helen Kent ."
"Who would you like to talk to ?"
"I'd like to talk to Mr . Edna Kent ."
"Is that Mr . Edna Kent ?"
"That's right ."
"What number are you calling from , please ?"
"From code 513 , 432-6748 ."
"And the number in Japan , please ?"
"Country code is 81 , area code 138 , and the number is 846-8972 ."
"Hold the line , please . I'll put your call through . "
"How long would you stay , sir ?"
"Two nights ."
"Would you please fill in this registration form ?"
"I've finished . "
"Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ?"
"You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service ."
"Do you charge for delivery ?"
"Wo will deliver the goods to you for free ."
"Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ?"
"Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number ."
"OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ?"
"No later than tomorrow ."
"Thanks . "
"Hello , is that Mr . Li ?"
"Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ?"
"I am calling to check your information before the interview . What position did you apply ?"
"I am applying for the waiter in your pub ."
"Excuse me . Could you slow down a little ? I couldn't catch you ."
"Sure . I will try my best to slow down . "
"Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment ?"
"The Employment Development Office will send you a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter ."
"What is contained in that letter ?"
"In addition to telling you how much you will receive , the beginning and ending dates of your claim will be included ."
"Will the Award Letter tell me what I need to fill out next ?"
"You will receive a Continued Claim Form and every two weeks , you must turn it in ."
"When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ?"
"You must show where and when you tried to look for work . If you earned any money , you need to tell them about it ."
"What other information does the form ask for ?"
"You have to tell them if you were too sick to work on any of the days that you should have been looking for work . "
"Do you know Yahoo Greetings , Edgar ?"
"Sure . It's a popular e-card website ."
"Can you tell me how to send one on it ?"
"Okay . Did you get the Yahoo ID ?"
"ID ? What's that ?"
"I mean , you must register first before you send a card ."
"Oh . I see . But I have done it ."
"Ok . Choose the card which you like best , and fill in the following blanks with both your and your friend's names and e-mail addresses ."
"Is that all ?"
"Don't forget to send ."
"Oh . I see . Thanks . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player ."
"Sure . Any particular model ?"
"Yes . The DS102 series ."
"Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular ."
"Will you be getting more in ."
"Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . "
"Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it ."
"Okay ."
"It ’ s the one you like ."
"Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one ."
"Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ’ rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ’ s nothing damaged , we ’ ll give you back one month ’ s rent when you move out . You ’ ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ?"
"Sure !"
"Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back ."
"Okay . Thank you for your reminder ."
"You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in ."
"Thank you again . "
"Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it ."
"Who is the author ?"
"Charles Dickens ."
"Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week ."
"Ok , Thanks . "
"Mr . Blake ? Mr . Foster ’ s on the phone . He ’ d like to know if you can send over those training manuals ?"
"Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon ."
"He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon ."
"I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t do that . They ’ re at the printer ’ s being copied . They ’ ll be back tomorrow before 1 o ’ clock . "
"Hello . Can I speak to Kevin , please ?"
"This is Kevin ."
"My name is Joan Harris . I ’ m calling from St . Johns Hospital . Are you still interested in a job as a service technician ?"
"Yes ."
"I have good news for you.You ’ Ve got an interview . Can you come to the Human Resources Office on Thursday at 9 30 am ?"
"wow ! That ’ s great . Sure , I can . Where is the Human Resources Office ?"
"345 Stony Creek Avenue ."
"Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time ."
"Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . "
"What do you expect to be doing five years from now ? What are your medium-term career goals ?"
"I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable . "
"This is a precious opportunity for us and our company ."
"You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . "
"What are you eating ?"
"Rice ."
"Why ?"
"Because it's supposed to be good for you . "
"I'd like to start by talking about prices ."
"I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have ."
"Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high ."
"If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable ."
"I know , but we want 1000 pieces . This is a very large order . So , can you give us a 25 percent discount ? "
"Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old ."
"Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro ."
"Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint ."
"No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places ."
"This is one of my favorite items ."
"How did you get it ? "
"What did you do at the office today ?"
"I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order ."
"What kind of things did you need to check ?"
"The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices ."
"I see . Did anything else happen ?"
"I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements ."
"It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client ."
"Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client ."
"I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ?"
"Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour ."
"You certainly had a busy day ."
"That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . "
"What post have you held before ?"
"I have been a salesman ."
"How many places have you worked altogether ? "
"Would you make me a dust coat out of this serge ?"
"Sure.Let me measure for you ."
"What's the charge ?"
"$ 200 . The delivery time is 2 weeks ."
"OK.thank you . "
"Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ?"
"Yes , it is ."
"I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time ."
"Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ?"
"Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total ."
"I got it . Thank you so much ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"Hello , Sir , may I help you ?"
"Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan ."
"Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans ."
"I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?"
"It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !"
"It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score ."
"That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan ."
"You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! "
"Good morning , can I help you ?"
"We'd like to buy some furniture for our new house ."
"Here are several sets of furniture , including sofa , dressing table , wardrobe , and sideboard . How about this one ?"
"We like a larger wardrobe . "
"Steven , what's your idea of price ?"
"The best we can do is $ 120 per case ."
"I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent ."
"I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices ."
"Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior ."
"It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ?"
"Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes ."
"Take your time , please . "
"What's that ?"
"These drawings on the wall are process sheets ."
"Oh ."
"They describe how each process goes on to the next . "
"I'm looking for the produce section , please ."
"All of the produce is in aisle A ."
"Are bananas on sale today ?"
"Here you go . Look in this flyer , or check with the produce person . "
"Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar ."
"Do you have anything to declare ?"
"No , these are all my personal effects ."
"What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?"
"Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?"
"No.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings ."
"Thank you . "
"Did you listen to the weather forecast ?"
"No.Why ?"
"There ’ s a typhoon coming ."
"No way !"
"Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . "
"May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ?"
"This is Liu Fang speaking ."
"Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email ."
"May I have your name , please ?"
"My name is Steven . May I ask whether I can have an interview ?"
"Of course . In my opinion , you are the strongest candidate for the job ."
"When is it most convenient for me to visit you to talk about the position ?"
"I want to set up an interview for you at 9 a . m . next Monday in our company's conference room ."
"Thank you very much . See you then . "
"What is your policy on returns ?"
"If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free ."
"Sounds good ."
"That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ?"
"Charge . Here's my card ."
"Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much ."
"Thank you . "
"OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year ."
"What's the running speed of the machine ?"
"About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now ."
"And what's the maximum output ?"
"If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . "
"Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?"
"Let me see . That one goes for $ 17 ."
"Would you take $ 12 ?"
"No , I can ’ t give it to you , let you have it for 12 . How about 14 ?"
"13.50 ?"
"Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . "
"I'm looking for a gift for my daughter ."
"How about a laptop ?"
"Yes , she needs something to help her at school ."
"How about a Mac ?"
"That sounds good . How much is one ?"
"Our newest 15 - inch Pro is only $ 2,100 ."
"Only $ 2,100 ? Okay , let me have one ."
"That's great . Will that be cash , check , or credit card ?"
"Let me dig my VISA out of my purse ."
"Okay , if you'll just sign here , please ."
"Do I need to buy anything else ?"
"All she has to do is open the box and follow the instructions ."
"Thank you so much ."
"Thank you . If you have any problems , just call . "
"Brian , a company called me for an interview ."
"That's great ! You need to prepare for it ."
"How ?"
"Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview ."
"Okay ."
"Buy an expensive suit ."
"How expensive ?"
"The more expensive , the better ."
"I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ?"
"That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company ."
"How ?"
"If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine ."
"Is a white blouse okay ?"
"Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes ."
"Black ?"
"Black is good ."
"White pantyhose ?"
"No . Dark or skin colored ."
"Jewelry ?"
"Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry ."
"How about make up ?"
"Not much make up ."
"Perfume ?"
"Yes , some . But be aware that different people may like different scents . "
"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company ."
"Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it ."
"You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?"
"Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions ."
"Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something ."
"Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . "
"Hello . I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car.And I wonder if it is still available ?"
"Yes , it's still available ."
"Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ?"
"Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape . "
"Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities ."
"I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi ."
"Do they have a swimming pool ?"
"No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there ."
"What ’ s the service like ?"
"It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends ."
"It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ?"
"There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management ."
"I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world ."
"Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card ."
"Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ?"
"No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal ."
"One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips ."
"I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . "
"Do you like shopping at flea markets ?"
"l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover ."
"The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen ."
"That's not very easy to say ."
"It's also known as Les Puces , which means ‘ The Fleas ' ."
"Can you find many bargains there ?"
"Well , it really depends . Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . "
"I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card ."
"OK.What do you want to know ?"
"We only need to verify your information against our records ."
"OK ."
"Please show me your passport and Residence Permit ."
"Here you are ."
"How long have you been living here ?"
"Two years ."
"May I know your occupation ?"
"I'm a professor at a university ."
"Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ?"
"I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes ."
"Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . "
"Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ?"
"It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly ."
"OK , Madam . We are here to help ."
"I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet ."
"I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan ."
"I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ?"
"The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form ."
"Right ... anything else ?"
"Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral ."
"And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . "
"Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ?"
"I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection ."
"I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents ."
"But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?"
"I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up ."
"To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost ."
"Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . "
"What kind of personality do you think you have ?"
"I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done ."
"Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?"
"I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others ."
"What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?"
"I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better ."
"What kind of people do you like to work with ?"
"People who are honest , dedicate to their work and have integrity ."
"What kind of people do you find difficult to work with ?"
"Slacker and those who violate working procedures and ignoring deadlines . "
"Plaza Hotel , good morning . Leo speaking ."
"Ah yes , I'd like to book two rooms for myself and my father . Could you tell me the cost of a single room per night ?"
"Certainly . A single room is 120 dollars American , per night ."
"Fine ."
"And when would you like the rooms ?"
"From the 25th to the 28tri of September ."
"Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ?"
"That's right ."
"Just a minute please ."
"Yes , we have rooms available then . You require two single rooms ?"
"Yes , thank you ."
"Can l have your name please ?"
"My name is Mona White ."
"And your father's name , Ms White ?"
"Jack Webber ."
"Could you spell the surname please ?"
"Sure . W-E-double B-E-R ."
"Double P for Papa ?"
"No , double B for Bravo "
"How may I help you ?"
"I ’ m having a problem ."
"What is it ?"
"I apparently owe some fees , but I never got the bank statement ."
"I do apologize for that ."
"My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay ."
"I see your problem ."
"What are you going to do about it ?"
"I will cancel the fees you owe ."
"I don ’ t have to pay any fees ?"
"You ’ ll only have to pay the initial fee ."
"That ’ s fine . I appreciate your help . "
"I fired Mr . Li today ."
"That's terrible . "
"Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?"
"No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance ."
"Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ?"
"Well , how old is your baby ?"
"No more than three ."
"The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand ."
"How about its quality ?"
"You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum ."
"OK , what is this ?"
"It is feeding-bottle as the free gift ."
"It is thoughtful . I will take it . "
"You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ?"
"Yes , I can ."
"Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed ."
"Then how about the expenses during the trips ?"
"The company will pay all the expenses ."
"Would you tell me where we often travel ?"
"Usually Shanghai , Qingdao , Hong Kong and so on ."
"It's great ! I like these places ."
"And you need to go abroad once in a while . Can you ?"
"Yes , I can ."
"After the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on ."
"I see ."
"You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time , which depends on the circumstances ."
"OK . Thank you very much for telling me all these things . "
"Farmington ? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did ? I don ’ t think we can use them ."
"Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this ."
"I know , Mr . Farmington . But , I ’ m not sure that I should bring this up with him . I think it would be better if you spoke to him ."
"All right . Leave these ads with me . I ’ ll speak to him this morning . "
"Is there anything I can dor you ?"
"Yes . I am looking for a restaurant with a cheerful atmosphere ."
"Why not go the youth restaurant ? You will have a happy lunch there ."
"Well , thanks for your help . "
"What is the great trait in your personality ?"
"I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas ."
"So you may like inventive jobs ."
"Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . "
"What would you be doing in U . S . A ?"
"Most of the time I'll be on a tour , enjoying the beautiful scenery there ."
"What do you want to see particularly ?"
"I'll go to the Yellow Stone Park , and Great Canyon . "
"are you ready for the meeting ?"
"yes , come on in . how's your new job going ?"
"it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit ."
"that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager ."
"thanks a lot ."
"how's your assistant manager getting on ?"
"well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass ."
"what seems to be the problem ?"
"well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing ."
"if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ?"
"to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him ."
"I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management ."
"I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people ."
"there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers ."
"that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! "
"Please take a seat ."
"Thanks ."
"Now what can I do for you ?"
"Well , I'm looking for a job ."
"Fine , but first I need some information about you ."
"What kind of information do you want ?"
"Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ?"
"Wilson ."
"And your other names ?"
"Steven Michael ."
"Have you got your e-mail address ?"
"Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com ."
"How old are you ?"
"Twenty-one ."
"Where were you Bron ?"
"In California . "
"Excuse me . How much for one are these ?"
"Un .. Those are 25 dollars each ."
"OK . Say I was to buy four , could I get a discount ?"
"Well , I could offer you maybe 10 percent off ."
"Oh , I was hoping to get one free . Like four for 75 dollars ."
"This one I'd better chat with the manager . Could you give me a second ? "
"Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ?"
"My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis ."
"What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ?"
"First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . "
"Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment ."
"Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C ."
"Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C ."
"But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it ."
"Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say ."
"Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ?"
"This afternoon . "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'd like to buy these razors ."
"Okay , that'll be $ 6.85 with tax . "
"Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card ."
"Thank you very much ."
"I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company ."
"I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job ."
"Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ?"
"I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system ."
"How do you work with a team ?"
"I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members ."

"Okay . Thanks . "
"Your total comes to $ 36.78 ."
"Put it on my VISA ."

"What ’ s wrong with it ?"
"I believe it was declined ."
"You ’ re kidding me !"
"Do you have another card I could try ?"
"I only have one card ."
"Do you have cash , perhaps ?"
"I don ’ t have any cash on me ."

"Do you feel nauseous ?"
"Yes , occasionally ."
"Do you have regular bowel movements ?"
"I think so ."
"Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much ."
"Is it serious ?"
"Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient . "
"Switchboard . Which extension would you like ?"
"Extension 1616 , please ."
"I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please ."
"Then , will you try extension 235 ?"
"Certainty , sir . "
"Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"Yes , I'd like to buy a color TV ."
"We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones , too . Do you have a specific model in mind ?"
"No . Which one do you recommend ?"
"This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture ."
"Thank you , but I'd prefer to buy a China-made set ."
"Which brand do you prefer ?"
"Sky worth ."
"OK . Come with me , please . "
"Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ?"
"Is this Susan ?"
"No , I'm the operator ."
"Oh well , do you know if the Susan Li is available ?"
"One moment and I'll check . "
"Honey , could you help me operate the VD player ? It can't play ."
"Oh , are the connections correct ?"
"I think so ."
"Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency ."
"I'm too careless ."
"Can it work now ?"
"No ."
"So what's the problem ? Maybe there is something wrong with the disk ."
"It's a new disk ."
"Give it to me ."
"Here you are ."
"Uh , the movie of Tom Hanks . I know why it can't play . This is a DVD disk . "
"What did you buy at the market ?"
"I bought some special local products ."
"You seem to have bought the whole market !"
"Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut ."
"Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals ."
"Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ?"
"All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes ."
"Then I will buy some tomorrow ."
"Why do you want to buy so much ?"
"Because I want to send them to my friends ."
"I see . "
"Hello , Mr . Kramer . Could you spare a minute ?"
"That ’ s about all I can spare , Karen . What do you need ?"
"I need to talk to you about that new secretary you ’ Ve hired . I think I ’ m going to have some problems working with her ."
"She seems to be quite qualified . If it ’ s a personal problem , I ’ d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves . "
"How much will it amount to ?"
"Wait a minute . It's $ 80.5 ."
"Do you receive traveler's checks ?"
"Sorry , sir . We accept cash only . "
"Good morning , Mr . Smith ."
"Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ?"
"It is 9 o'clock now ."

"OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts ."
"No problem . Do you need the OHP ?"
"Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ?"
"OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ?"
"That would be great ! You are really a good employee . "
"Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate !"
"lt's a TV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card ."
"You won't need it . Tom is going to treat everybody !"
"Where is Tom ? It was his idea to have the bachelor party at a ETV , wasn't it ?"
"If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing ."
"Then I bet he's really good !"
"Well , uh , I'll let you decided that for you yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ."

"OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! "

"Easy as pie ! We can get everything set up for you right away . Then , you'll be shopping securely online in no time at all . "
"Can I help you , sir ?"
"You have so many antiques and Chinese paintings here . May I have a look first ?"
"Of course ."
"Are they genuine ?"
"Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced . "
"Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ?"
"10:15 a . m ."
"Can I get the ticket here ?"
"Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter ."
"Thank you . "
"Here I raise a question for you . Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan . Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ?"
"Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate ."
"Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ?"
"It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group ."
"And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ?"
"Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know ."

"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?"
"Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store ."
"That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?"
"Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off ."
"True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time ."
"Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places ."
"Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not ."
"That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to ."
"I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . "
"Would you mind if I ask the insurance policy of our company ?"

"Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine ."
"Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know . "
"Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce ."
"You might want to try the mangoes ."
"Can you describe a mango to me ?"
"It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it ."
"Do I eat the seed ?"
"Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years ."
"What's the price of these mangoes ?"
"Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each ."
"Tell me what they taste like ."
"Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet ."
"Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ?"
"Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat ."
"Where do mangoes come from ?"
"These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . "

"Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ?"
"In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price ."
"I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours ."
"But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year ."
"It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . "
"Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement ."
"Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ?"
"Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out ."
"OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ?"
"Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % ."
"Can we add up this item to the agreement ?"
"Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ?"
"No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ?"
"Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily ."
"Thank you . I'll work hard . "

"May I bring you a salad ?"
"Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ?"
"Rose-petal salad ."

"I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount ."
"Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer ."
"That's understood . "
"Speed Airlines Reservation . May I help you ?"
"Yes . Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th ? I want one leaving in the afternoon ."

"Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?"
"I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . "
"Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?"
"Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ?"
"I never had a home inspection before ."
"I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through ."
"I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house ."
"The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future ."
"I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes ."
"I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems ."
"What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?"
"I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . "

"You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ?"

"Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ?"
"I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith ."
"He is on the line . "
"Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ?"
"Sure . You mean this one ?"
"No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you ."
"It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook !"
"That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ?"
"The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 . "
"I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club ."
"Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ?"
"Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !"
"Cool !"
"I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... , So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ?"
"No . I borrowed it to go shopping . "
"Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener ."
"I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market ."
"I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit ."
"People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us ."
"The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go ."
"Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers ."
"I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now ."
"Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . "
"What ? Your diamond ring is lost ?"
"Yeah , I just cannot find it anywhere ."
"It must have been stolen by the few thieves . I ’ ll get it back for you ."
"You are risking your neck . Don ’ t you know they have guns . "
"Is this the first time you've come to our city , Mr . Ross ?"
"Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company ."
"I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ?"
"That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company ."
"We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . "
"Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?"
"Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are ."
"I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It's on sale , isn't it ."
"Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain ."
"I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?"
"Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?"
"It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters ."
"I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better ."
"OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . "
"What ’ s up ? You look so blue ."
"Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie . "
"Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ?"
"Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business ."
"Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order ."
"You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum ."
"Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me ."
"Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . "
"Hi , I ’ m Mary Smith ."
"Hello , I ’ m the landlord . John Taylor ."
"Nice to meet you Mr . Taylor ."
"Please , call me John ."
"O . K ."
"John . Well , can I have a look at the place ?"
"Sure . Come on it . We just finished rebuilding everything ."
"Oh , it hasn ’ t been painted yet ."
"No , we ’ re going to get that done next week ."
"Well . It ’ s certainly nice . You ’ Ve done a great job ."
"Thank you ."
"The rent is $ 600 a month ?"
"That ’ s right ."
"Well , I think I ’ ll take it . Can I write you a check for the security deposit now ? $ 1200 ?"
"Yeah . But why don ’ t you come by your office tomorrow to sign the lease ?"
"That would be fine ."
"Thank you . See you tomorrow ."
"See you . "
"Excuse me ."
"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?"
"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare ."
"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order ."
"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?"
"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes ."
"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . "
"What's this city famous for ?"
"Tea and silk ."
"Where can we have the famous tea ?"
"Preferably at the big department stores ."
"Thank you . "
"What kind of document is an invoice ?"
"It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment ."
"How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ?"
"Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice ."
"What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ?"
"By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination ."
"Oh , I see . "
"With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ?"
"What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ?"
"Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker ."
"So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ?"
"In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . "
"Hi , Paulo . How are things going ?"
"Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 ."
"That's good news . What stage are you at now ?"
"Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? "
"Good afternoon , Pan Am . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to New York for 18th next month ."
"Please wait a moment . Let me check for you.The flight is FW 711 and it arrives at 10:00 am ."
"How long is that journey ?"
"14 hours ."
"Thank you . "
"Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song ."
"What's so special about this song ?"
"It's from the musical that is so popular in New York right now . Do you like it ?"
"Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me ."
"That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation ."
"I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited ."
"Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ?"
"I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz . "
"Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited !"
"Congratulations ! By the way , have you had all the things ready for the interview ?"
"I only typed several copies of my resume ."
"That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare ."
"What are they ?"
"Besides the resume , you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your ID card ."
"I see , Also several copies of your one-inch color photos ."
"Yes , I have those ."
"You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best ."
"I will get it soon ."
"Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying ."
"Ok , I will remember ."
"All these should be enough . Good luck ! "
"Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ?"
"Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... , It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?"
"I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !"
"Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus ."
"I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine ."
"No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans ."
"Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! "
"I am really interested in buying this television ."
"That's great !"
"How much are you selling it for ?"
"This TV is $ 2500 ."
"You can't be serious ."
"That's how much this t . v costs ."
"That's too expensive for me ."
"This television is of very high quality ."
"You can't go down on the price ?"
"By how much ?"
"I'll buy it for $ 2000 ."
"I'm sorry , but the price is final . "
"What are you doing ?"
"Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty ."
"Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful !"
"Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?"
"I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural ."
"Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well ."
"I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing ."
"I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive ."
"You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts !"
"Really ?"
"Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! "
"morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking ."
"Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week ."
"Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job ."
"Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! "
"What time's your flight ?"
"It's at 7:30 a . m . "
"Hello , this is 5735647 5 ."
"Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please ."
"This is Linda ."
"Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening ."
"Really ? What time and which restaurant ?"
"At seven thirty pm , Longing Chinese restaurant.And I'll go to your home and pick you up at 7 ."
"Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ?"
"No , have a nice day !"
"Thank you . Bye ."
"See you . "
"What ’ s the matter , dear ?"
"Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag ."
"Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?"
"No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about ."
"You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one ."
"I ’ d better go tomorrow ."
"No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? "
"Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ?"
"Squid balls ? How about some more fruit !"
"Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates !"
"Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... , Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . "
"Mon and I got in another fight , Boris ."
"oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ?"
"it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no ."
"I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat ."
"oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them ."
"I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth ."
"But , Boris , i am not a baby any more ."
"well , that's true ."
"how about your mother ?"
"she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals ."
"poor you . It seems we are in the same boat ."
"Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit ."
"really ? so you don't have fried food at all ."
"not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much ."
"how do you manage it ?"
"it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . "
"So , got any more ideas for the website ?"
"Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room ."
"But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there ."
"The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient ."
"You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things ."
"Or discuss what gifts they could buy together ."
"Any other ideas ?"
"We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments ."
"And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... , Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ?"
"No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! "
"Hi , Cole . What can I do for you ?"
"if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company ."
"sure , have a seat ."
"thanks ."
"let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ?"
"I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now ."
"one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ?"
"yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement ."
"I see . What job did you have in mind ."
"well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager ."
"do you understand what duties that job would entail ?"
"yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too ."
"that's right . Do you have any experience in management ?"
"yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job ."
"well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in , ok . Thanks for your support . "
"Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat ."
"Thank you ."
"So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background ."
"Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology ."
"Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?"
"Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service ."
"Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle ."
"Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction ."
"Interesting ... , Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . "
"We still have an important attraction ."
"What is that ?"
"Melbourne Zoo ."
"What's special about Melbourne Zoo ?"
"The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats ."
"Are the animals caged ?"
"Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . Rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens ."
"That's really special ."
"Of course , I'm sure you will like it . "
"Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?"
"I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table ."
"You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China ."
"I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick ."
"You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends ."
"A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood ."
"Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you ."
"I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . "
"May I help you , sir ?"
"Yes , I'd like some information about the trains to Beijing ."
"When do you want to go ?"
"On July 7 , I have to be there well before twelve o ’ clock ."
"There ’ s a train at 7 a . m . It'll get you there at 11 a . m . But there are many stops along the way ."
"And I have to get up early , too . Are there any non-stop trains to Beijing ?"
"Yes , there is one at 8: 30 a . m . That arrives at 11:35 a . m . "
"Next please ."
"I want to send this letter to the US by airmail ."
"That'll be five yuan forty , please . "
"Could you show me some scarves ?"
"What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes ."
"Show me some of the latest fashion , please ."
"At your service . Will this suit you ?"
"Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce ."
"This is Chinese made ."
"Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ?"
"Yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price ."
"But that still sounds expensive ."
"Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . "
"I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight !"
"And the problem is , sir ?"
"Cockroaches have taken over my room !"
"My apologies , sir . We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room ."
"Thank you . I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others ."
"We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible . "
"What sights are included on the tour ? Is the entire time spent in Paris ?"
"All of the major sights are included . You'll visit the Louvre , the Eiffel Tower and all of the top museums . You'll also take a day trip out of Paris to Versailles ."
"Can you fax a copy of the tour itinerary to me ?"
"Of course . Just give me your fax number ."
"It's 212-331-7600 ."
"Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately . "
"Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ?"
"Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ?"
"L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too ."
"So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! "
"Did you take the job ?"
"No ."
"Why not ?"
"It involves a lot of travel . "
"May I help you ?"
"I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot ."
"I can assist you ."
"How are you going to help me ?"
"I actually work here ."
"Fabulous . Thanks ."
"Do you have ID ?"
"I have it right here ."
"Here ’ s your ballot card ."
"Now what am I supposed to do ?"
"Just take it to a booth and begin voting ."
"Sounds good . Thanks . "
"Something's wrong with my air conditioning ."
"Leave it to me . I'll fix it . "
"How much do you expect to earn ?"
"I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ?"
"If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market ."
"I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary ."
"Ok . "
"What is your salary now ?"
"My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month ."
"What's your expected salary ?"
"What is important to me is the job and the people who I will be working with , so regarding salary , I leave it to you and I am sure that you will make me a fair offer ."
"I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ?"
"Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it ."
"Any question about the work ?"
"To whom should I report ?"
"The general manager of your section ."
"What are the benefits ?"
"We'll offer that on holidays ."
"I would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ?"
"Yes , we have inspection abroad ."
"Thank you . Then I think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent ."
"Okay . "
"I would like to have a custom-made skirt ."
"May I take your size ?"
"OK . I want it a bit close around the waist ."
"No problem ."
"How long will it take ?"
"About a week ."
"What ’ s the charge for the tailoring ?"
"20 yuan for a skirt . "
"I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit ."
"I'm very sorry to hear that ."
"Please handle future shipments with more care ."
"We'll take great care . "
"Oath , I think I broke my leg ."
"Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair ."
"Thanks ."
"The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions ."
"All right ."
"Name , age and date of birth , please ."
"John Taylor , 32 , May 23 , 1970 ."
"Health insurance company and policy number ?"
"I don ’ t have it ."
"What ?"
"I don ’ t have health insurance ."
"Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor ."
"Ohhhh ! "
"Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate ."
"Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal ."
"Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ?"
"I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean ."
"I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . "
"Welcome to China , Mr . White ."
"How do you do , Ms . Chi ?"
"Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ?"
"Thank you ."
"Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind ."
"Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it ."
"Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery ."
"I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles ."
"Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles ."
"Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ?"
"We normally export CFR ."
"What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis ."
"That can be discussed ."
"All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ?"
"What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel ."
"I'll be expecting you , then . "
"Wow , it has a balcony ."
"Yeah . Complete with nice of you ."
"How many windows are there in the apartment ?"
"Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen ."
"It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign ."
"I call the landlord right now ."
"Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ?"
"Yes , does the renting include utilities ?"
"It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone ."
"How much is the cable ?"
"It usually comes out about $ 40 a month ."
"Also , are they allowing the apartment ?"
"No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted ."
"I see . Do you love pets ?"
"Sorry , that ’ s out of question . I don ’ t have a problem with it . But , unfortunately , the building doesn ’ t allow it . It ’ s a building regulation . "
"We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ?"
"We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning ."
"No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ?"
"We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % ."
"Are you kidding ?"
"No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... "
"I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?"
"Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ?"
"I want to have a foot massage and a haircut ."
"A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion ."
"Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures ."
"This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor !"
"I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ?"
"Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress ."
"Maybe we should try a thai massage too ."
"What ’ s special about a thai massage ?"
"That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet ."
"Sounds painful ! "
"What are in this folder ?"
"They are reports of our company ."
"Are they filed alphabetically ?"
"No , they are filed according to dates ."
"Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?"
"No problem , here you are . "
"Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ?"
"That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept ."
"Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles ."
"Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging ."
"As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton ."
"Carton ?"
"Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes ."
"Could you use wooden cases instead ?"
"Why use wooden cases ?"
"I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation ."
"Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps ."
"All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling ."
"You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ?"
"That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit ."
"Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment ."
"No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?"
"Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties ."
"Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity ."
"Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions ."
"Exactly . That's what we have done in the past ."
"Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days ."
"Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 ."
"Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature ."
"That's fine too . "
"How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun !"
"They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem ."
"An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia ."
"It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive ."
"That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ?"
"No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . "
"I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ’ s China Head quarters ."
"That ’ s true . I got the news yesterday ."
"You did a good job for the company . So , this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ?"
"Not bad . I ’ m confident . And I like challenges ."
"I believe you are cut out for this position ."
"Thank you . "
"I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment ."
"Is that so ?"
"Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on ."
"Have you decided ?"
"Yes , I want to get a better job ."
"Could you tell me why you want to quit ?"
"I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues ."
"Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I "" m sure something can be worked out ."
"I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay ."
"OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . "
"Hello , there . How can I help ?"
"Hello . I'm hoping to buy some Treasury Certificates today . Are they available ?"
"Certainly , Visible Treasury Certificates . Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment . Hence the ' visible ' , you can see it ."
"Ah , right . How much do I need to spend ?"
"The minimum is 100 RIB , and the maximum is 500,000 RIB ."
"How about Bearer Certificates ? Are they different ?"
"Yes , they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts . Just 100 RIB , 500 RIB and 1,000 RIB , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see . "
"How are you ?"
"I ’ m fabulous ."
"What can I help you with ?"
"I need to make a withdrawal ."
"How much are you withdrawing today ?"
"I need $ 300 ."
"What account would you like to take this money from ?"
"Take it from my checking account ."
"Here ’ s your $ 300 ."
"Thank you so much ."
"Will you be needing anything else ?"
"That ’ s it for today . "
"It's time to go to bed ."
"But mum , we're watching this movie ."
"I don't care , it's school in the morning ."
"Just 10 more minutes . "
"Mum , pass me some more please !"
"Tina , you should have more nutritious food.Don ' t eat these crisps any more ."
"But the ads say they're most nutritious ."
"Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here ."
"Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students ."
"I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer ."
"Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory ."
"Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?"
"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ?"
"History ."
"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your , Thirty percent ?"
"Yes ."
"Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?"
"Yes . It's an excellent system ."
"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?"
"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing ."
"I don't want Macintosh . I want PC ."
"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment ."
"What ? Are you serious ?"
"Yes ."
"But nobody uses Macintosh !"
"That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma , Yes , I'm from Taiwan ."
"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used ."
"But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese ."
"There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple ."
"Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry ."
"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple ."
"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later ."
"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . "
"Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ?"
"Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me ."
"Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment ."
"Is there anything else ?"
"There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments ."
"And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts ."
"If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions ."
"In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . "
"IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ?"
"Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers ."
"Hello , Mr Gwent . What can I do for you today ?"
"Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin . Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet ?"
"Of course . Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency ?"
"Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars ."
"Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal . "
"Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose ."
"I can recommend the spare ribs . They are very tasty here ."
"Actually , I ate too much pork yesterday . I fancy a change ."
"Ok why don ’ t you order the braised fish then ?"
"That sounds like a good idea . It looks very big though ."
"Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll help you eat it . "
"Are you a goal-oriented person ?"
"Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything ."
"How do you plan to do your present job ?"
"I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . "
"Good day ! What can we do for you ?"
"I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me ."
"Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs ."
"That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though ."
"With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price ."
"That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself ."
"That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this ."
"The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . "
"In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ?"
"Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ?"
"How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ?"
"I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period ."
"Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset ."
"Thanks for your praise , Madam . "
"How do you usually part your hair ?"
"To the right ."
"( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ?"
"Looks good ."
"Would you like a shave ?"
"No , thanks ."
"Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming ."
"Thank you . "
"Good afternoon , San Felice Hotel . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to book a room , please ."
"Certainly . When for , madam ?"
"March the 23rd ."
"How long will you be staying ?"
"Three nights ."
"What kind of room would you like , madam ?"
"Er ... double with bath . I'd appreciate it if you could give me a room with a view over the lake ."
"Certainly , madam . I'll just check what we have available . . . Yes , we have a room on the 4th floor with a really splendid view ."
"Fine . How much is the charge per night ?"
"Would you like breakfast ?"
"No , thanks ."
"It's eighty four euro per night excluding VAT ."
"That's fine ."
"Who's the booking for , please , madam ?"
"Mr and Mrs Ryefield , that's R-Y-E-F-I-E-L-D ."
"Okay , let me make sure I got that , Yes it is . Thank you ."
"Let me give you your confirmation number . It's 7576385 . I'll repeat that , 7576385 . Thank you for choosing San Felice Hotel and have a nice day . Goodbye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to tonight's fashion show ."
"We see you are all dressed to the nines ."
"How very appropriate , because tonight we have a most dazzling show for you !"
"Yes , this runway is going to sparkle with glamour and style !"
"Some of tonight's highlights are dressed in the latest straight from Shanghai ."
"And others directly from New York ."
"So , sit back and relax and get your order forms ready ."
"Because you're going to love this show ! "
"Hello , towing service . What ’ s your problem ?"
"Yes . I need a tow truck . My car is broken down ."
"Where are you now ?"
"I ’ m on the Highway 401 , close to the Lipton Link ."
"All right . I got it . What color is your car ?"
"Black ."
"And plate number ."
"AKIM 400 ."
"Okay . Just stay in your car . We ’ ll be there in five minutes ."
"Thanks a lot . "
"Good evening , I have a reservation under the name of Tomlinson ."
"Ok I ’ Ve found it . Checking out on the 27th ?"
"That ’ s right ."
"Can I take a credit card for the deposit ?"
"Yes , sure . Also , I ’ d like a non-smoking room please ."
"Certainly madam . Here ’ s your key . Your room is on the 7th floor and on the left . Room 781 . Check out is at 12 noon . "
"So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley ."
"Sure , what ’ s up ?"
"Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company ."
"Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ?"
"Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting !"
"Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... , But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients ."
"Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff !"
"Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . "
"Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage ."
"Yes , Mary ?"
"We'd like you to come to work for us ."
"Oh . I'm sorry but I just accepted another offer which I feel is better suited to my needs ."
"I see ."
"I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it ."
"Please call us if you change your mind ."
"I will , good luck . "
"Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ?"
"It is because of the quality ."
"Could you tell me the particulars ?"
"I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ?"
"Yes , I do ."
"The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard ."
"Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified ."
"I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . "
"Is this the foreign exchange department ?"
"Yes , can I help you ?"
"I need some US Dollars ."
"What kind of currency have you got ?"
"RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ?"
"One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan ."
"And I want to change 4000 Yuan ."
"Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here ."
"OK , thank you . "
"What case do you have against the police ?"
"I want to take them to court for arresting me ."
"I don ’ t understand ."
"There was no reason for them to arrest me ."
"They let you go , didn ’ t they ?"
"They released me the next morning ."
"They detained you at the station ?"
"That ’ s exactly what they did ."
"Why did they arrest you ?"
"They said I matched the description of a robber ."
"I get it now ."
"I ’ m definitely taking them to court . "
"Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ?"
"Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... "
"Hello , Fife Computers . How can I help ?"
"Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank ."
"Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ?"
"They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ?"
"What's the charge for that ?"
"It's 150 RIB for the service ."
"That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . "
"Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ?"
"Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic ."
"Sure , ma'am . Here you are ."
"Thank you . How much is it ?"
"25 yuan ."
"Here's 30 . Keep the change ."
"Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China . "
"How may I help you ?"
"There ’ s a problem with my check ."
"What problem ?"
"My check for $ 100 bounced ."
"Are you sure you have $ 100 in your checking account ?"
"I thought I did ."
"I ’ ll check for you ."
"Thank you very much ."
"It looks like you only have $ 57 left in your account ."
"That can ’ t be right !"
"That ’ s what my computer is showing ."
"All right . Thank you very much . "
"How is your house hunting going ?"
"Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet ."
"How much are you looking to spend ?"
"I can only afford about 300 pounds a month ."
"Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that ."
"Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room ."
"Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !"
"Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?"
"I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ?"
"I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get !"
"How long do you want to sign a contract for ?"
"I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that ."
"Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?"
"I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished ."
"You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?"
"No , I thought that would be included in the rent ."
"It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities ."
"I don't think I can afford that ."
"Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children ."
"That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . "
"Excuse me ."
"Yes ?"
"Do you have any information about the city sights ?"
"Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet ."
"Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?"
"Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a metro card at the station ."
"You ’ Ve been very helpful ."
"My pleasure . "
"Excuse me , is this the Guyon Travel Agency ?"
"Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?"
"I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ?"
"Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense ."
"Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ?"
"Zhouzhuang ."
"How long does the tour take ?"
"It's about two days ."
"what's the cost ?"
"It's about 300 yuan ."
"I know . Thank you very much ."
"That's all right . May you have a good trip !"
"Thank you ."
"My pleasure . "
"Are there pets allowed in this apartment ?"
"No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed ."
"What about a boa constrictor ?"
"Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ?"
"If I had one , could I rent this apartment ?"
"I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock ."
"What about a Gila monster ?"
"I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . "
"good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ?"

"You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ?"
"So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information , would you please call us 1 hour later ?"
"OK , thank you . "
"Man , they take a lot of our paycheck ."
"Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ?"
"Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck ."
"Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ?"
"Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old ."
"Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive ."
"Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it ."
"Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . "
"Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week ."
"If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ?"
"I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract ."
"Can I see it for a second ?"
"Sure , here it is ... , Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details ."
"Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ?"
"Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ?"
"I don't think so , why do you ask ?"
"The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... , Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . "
"Who finances the magazine ?"
"I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star ."
"Does it have a large circulation ?"
"Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . "
"Paul , can I set up a time with you to go over the training manual ?"
"Sure . Let me just grab my calendar . All right . I ’ m free all day Tuesday and Thursday morning ."
"Tuesday morning is good for me . How about 10:30 in my office ?"
"Okay . Sounds good . See you then . "
"And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ?"
"Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person ."
"Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ?"
"No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going ."
"What's your strong points ?"
"Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks ."
"What do you dislike most about your job ?"
"Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility ."
"What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?"
"A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question ."
"Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?"
"Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times ."
"How do you feel about overtime work ?"
"That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done ."
"What is most important to you in a job ?"
"I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work ."
"Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?"
"I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing ."
"Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?"
"Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy ."
"OK . What are your strong points ?"
"Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point ."
"And your weaknesses ?"
"I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . "
"Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ?"
"It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ?"
"The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements ."
"Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway ."
"There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV ."
"Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies ."
"No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable ."
"Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ?"
"Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years ."
"Get new friends ."
"Why are you always so mean ?"
"Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t ."
"I could help pay for it ."
"Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it ."
"O . K . Thanks , Mom ! "
"Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ?"
"Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques ."
"We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know ."
"Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . "
"My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers ."
"No wonder it looks so huge ."
"We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ."
"Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ?"
"It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake ."
"Very romantic ."
"Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake ."
"Sure ( They get on the boat ) ."
"Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion ."
"You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps . "
"Welcome , Mr . Sun ."
"Thank you for your entertaining me ."
"Today I'll invite you to enjoy the seafood.Please make yourself at home ."
"Excuse me , what business are you looking after in Germany ?"
"I am running Chinese arts and crafts ."
"What arts and crafts are you interested in this time ?"
"I hope to import some silk from Hangzhou to Germany . Can you help me ?"
"Sure , I'll certainly help you do it . "
"That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it ."
"I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now ."
"Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now ."
"Yes ."
"Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters ."
"What are you saying ? You are acting weird today ."
"I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too ."
"Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me ."
"That's all right . At least I got myself left ."
"Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel ."
"I hope that he would grant me with that ."
"Hope so . "
"Hello . Can I talk to David ?"
"One second , please . ( a few seconds later , the receiver comes back and says ) Hello ?"
"Yes ."
"I ’ m sorry . David is out to lunch right now ."
"Okay . I ’ m his wife . Could you tell him to call me back when he returns ?"
"Sure . Does he know where to call you ?"
"Oh , thanks . Please tell him to call my cell-phone number ."
"Ok , I will ."
"Thank you very much ."
"No problem . "
"David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ?"
"Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background ."
"But they can see my resume . It's all in there ."
"I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this ."
"Ok . What else ?"
"They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?"
"I see . What about the salary ?"
"Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it ."
"Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot ."
"Anytime . Let me know how it works out . "
"I passed all the tests , Mom ."
"Well done ! "
"Hi , is you , John ?"
"Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times ."
"Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day ."
"But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer ."
"I know , I left it at home ."
"Do you feel better now ?"
"It's OK now . Don't worry , John . "
"Jim . I heard you got a promotion !"
"Yeah , I ’ m going to be running the Walker Avenue Branch ."
"Congratulations , guy ."
"Thanks . I appreciate it . "
"Good morning . This is Dr . Mustn ’ s Office . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . This is Janet Smith . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Mustn as soon as possible ."
"Is it urgent ( an emergency ) ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve got an infected wound ."
"How about this afternoon at 2:00 ?"
"That ’ s fine ."
"Don ’ t forget to bring your health card with you ."
"I ’ ll bring the card . Thank you very much ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"We will have a vacation next month . Why not have a tour ?"
"Good idea . Where shall we go ?"
"What about going to Xi'an ?"
"Don't you think it is too far ?"
"So what's your plan ?"
"What about going to Beijing ?"
"So we'll compromise . We'll hit the Huangshan in Anti ."
"OK ! "
"Hi , United Airlines ? This is Elizabeth parks calling . I have a reservation on the 2:30 p . m . flight to Shanghai this afternoon ."
"Yes , Miss Parks ? How may I help you ?"
"Well , I ’ d like to reschedule my flight for the tomorrow morning one at 9:05 . Is that possible ?"
"I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . "
"Hello , Sir , may I help you ?"
"Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan ."
"Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans ."
"I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?"
"It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !"
"It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score ."
"That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan ."
"You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! "
"What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ?"
"We are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . We assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care ."
"But we can't accept your damage claim ."
"Why not ?"
"You didn't note the damage on the bill of lading . "
"What problems will exporters face in moving to the foreign market ?"
"An exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with ."
"Like what ?"
"What do they like or dislike . What languages do they speak , what religions do they follow ."
"Reasonable ."
"Especially he needs to know their behavior , their habits , their way of life and the things they are used to ."
"Sometimes people in different countries , or even in different parts of the same country have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture . "
"You know who won the election , right ?"
"I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected ."
"I couldn ’ t believe it , either ."
"He just made history ."
"I hope you voted for him ."
"Of course I did . Did you ?"
"I made sure to vote for him ."
"I am really excited about this ."
"I know how you feel ."
"Hopefully , he ’ ll change things in our nation ."
"I know that he will ."
"I trust him . "
"Would you find any other available flight to Tokyo ?"
"Sure . We try our best ."
"Thank you ."
"Mr.Chen , are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo ?"
"Yes , of course . I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us ."
"I'm afraid this flight is all booked up ."
"Are you sure ? We can't really take it ? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day ."
"I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers . "
"Mrcrabby , I ’ m pleased to see you ."
"I ’ Ve looked over your resume , ms.Jane . I see you ’ Ve already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ?"
"Oh , yes , I worked there for two years , just graduated from college ."
"En ?"
"It was a good company to work for , I enjoyed my time with them ."
"You like that work ?"
"Yes , I like it very much , the work was not very demanding , and the people I work with were friendly ."
"Why do you want to leave the company ?"
"Because it is an age of challenges , I must accept the new challenge in my life . "
"Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?"
"Yes , could you put me in the non-smoking section ?"
"Yes . Would you like a window seat ?"
"If one's available , please . But not over the wing . "
"Hi , Jim ! When did you get back ?"
"Yesterday . I was really sorry to see it end . The skiing was terrific !"
"I ’ m really jealous ! I won ’ t be able to get any time off for at least another three or four months ."
"Sorry to hear that ! But I would definitely recommend this place ! "
"hi , Betty.what ' s up ?"
"nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ?"
"everything has been fine for the past several months ."
"great !"
"well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners , sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ?"
"as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners ."
"absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features ."
"for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude ."
"yes . this must be a huge difference ."
"can you think of anything else ?"
"sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems ."
"I didn't know that before ."
"and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls ."
"i got it . i'll bear it in mind ."
"don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by ."
"I hope so . "
"If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory ."
"It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory ."
"Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you ."
"Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes ."
"That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . "
"So the apartment comes unfurnished ?"
"This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture ."
"We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners ."
"This building is only four years old . It was built with central air ."
"Just like in the States ! That's perfect !"
"And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . "
"S :: Welcome to Flash Foto.What can I do for you , ma ’ am ?"
"C :: I ’ d like to have this roll of film developed ."

"C :: Four by six will do ."
"S :: All right , ma ’ am , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . "

"So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group ."
"I think you will enjoy your journey . "
"Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company ."
"Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours ."
"Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ?"
"At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that ."
"But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period ."
"Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable ."
"One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , , Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . "
"Do you have your own circle of friends ?"
"Yes . I have friends even though I am a man of few words . Just like the old saying goes , "" Actions speak louder than words "" . I am a hard-working silent person ."
"What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ?"
"Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality ."
"OK , I got it . "
"I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m ."
"If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ?"
"Sorry , the whole afternoon is filled up here.Will tomorrow do ?"
"All right . "
"We should know by next month whom to hire . If your application is successful , we'll notify you by mail ."
"How long would I wait ?"
"We'll give you our decision in 7 days ."
"Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible ."
"Please send the next candidate in on your way out ."
"OK , good-bye . "
"Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... , For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step ."
"Certainly . And after your internship ?"
"They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills ."
"Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London ."
"The London Weekly right ?"
"Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . "
"morning , Mr . Winthrop . This is Sally Parker , Mr . Emory ’ s secretary . Mr . Emory has asked me to set up a meeting with you ."
"Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight !"
"I understand . Would you like me to call you back ?"
"No – That ’ s all right . How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? – Is an hour enough ? "
"Good morning ! The Inland hotel . How may I help you ?"
"Good morning . I ’ d like to book a room for Friday night and Saturday night ."

"Jones . According to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast ."
"We offer a 20 % discount for guests staying of Friday and Saturday . The total cost will be $ 80 , including breakfast ."
"Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you on Friday ."
"Could I just take your credit card number please ? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20 ."
"That ’ s fine . My credit card number is ... "
"Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer ."
"Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine ."
"For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model ."
"Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . "
"Mr Brown ! How nice to see you , can I help ?"
"I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting ."
"I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch ."
"How long a period will you look at to determine this ?"
"We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period ."
"That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend . "
"I want to buy a wallet ."
"Here are all the wallets with various designs . How about this one ? It is quite fashionable ."
"May I pick it up ?"
"Of course ."
"Do you have one of better quality ?"
"This one is much better , but it is also much more expensive ."
"There is no problem about the price . How much is it ?"
"Two hundred and thirty-five yuan ."
"OK , I'll take it . "
"Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office ."
"This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock ."
"Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office ."
"Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ?"
"Yes , that ’ s correct ."
"Ok . Thank you . "
"What's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset ."
"To be honest , I was just dumped ."
"Oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday cheer you up ."
"No , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling ."
"Come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?"
"I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing ."
"Well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?"
"Where is that ?"
"Not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours ."
"What's there to see ?"
"There is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes ."
"Oh , sounds nice ."
"Yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like , Ok . Then I can make up my mind . "
"Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks ."
"I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick ."
"Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here ."
"I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Douglas . "
"I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem ."
"I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir ."
"Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches ."
"Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check ."
"The next cockroach I see will be number ten ."
"Mr . Sandals , I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach ."
"I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you !"
"You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor "
"Where shall we go on vacation this summer ?"
"Well , that depends . Tell me where you want to go ?"
"Venice . I have great interests in the boats ."
"That's interesting to travel by boat to see the whole city that is between the sea and sky . But personally I like Greek better ."
"I like the country too . It's quite famous for its culture . "
"Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing ."
"Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga ."
"Mary , you say something about it ."
"Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . "
"How can I help you ?"
"I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend ."
"Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?"
"She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance ."
"OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes ."
"Which one would you recommend ?"
"Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?"
"That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please ."
"Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers ."
"It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy ."
"How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick ."
"She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big ."
"How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger ."
"No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is ."
"I know what she would like-some whitening cream ."
"No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter ."
"Will that be all then ?"
"That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . "
"that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up ."
"it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here ."
"I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?"
"I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth ."
"I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag ."
"afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks ."
"yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too ."
"Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious ."
"I think that she had a litter too much of the punch ."
"what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong ."
"that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ?"
"very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves ."
"that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ?"
"all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . "
"What sort of salary did you get at your previous job ?"
"Well , I got $ 3,000 per month ."
"I see . I am sure we can offer you $ 3 , 500 at the beginning . Would that be satisfactory ?"
"Yes , I think so . That would be more than I have wished ."
"Good . We also have health insurance , bonus and paid vacation . When can you begin to work ?"
"What about early next week ?"
"Good . Please come in on Monday . Working hours are from eight to four-thirty . Lunch is fifty-five minutes ."
"Yes , sir . "
"Tell me about how you work here ."
"We work in teams . There are about four to six people in each team . I'm training to be a team leader . Each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce . We are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs . I like that . It stops the work getting boring . "
"Would you please weight this letter for me ?"
"Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it ."
"How much ?"
"We demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it . "
"What is my schedule for today , Miss Liu ?"
"Yes , you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Clark . And this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants ."
"Do you have the meeting report ready ?"
"Certainly . "
"Where to , madam ?"
"Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train ."
"I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam ."
"Here is the Grand Central Station ."
"Thank you . How much is the fare ?"
"The meter reads 9.15 dollars ."
"Here you are . Keep the change ."
"Thank you . "
"May I see your passport please ?"
"Yes . Here it is ."
"Are you travelling for business or pleasure ?"
"I'm going to visit some relatives here for several months ."
"Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ?"
"The only things I brought were some cloths and my notebook computer ."
"Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ?"
"No , Sir , I did not . "
"We hope that our cooperation will continue ."
"Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation ."
"We do think so . "
"Welcome to our restaurant , Chez Attitude !"
"Our reservation is under the name of Foster at 7:00 for four people ."
"Yes , Mr . Foster , our hostess will be with you in just a moment ."
"We would like to begin with a cocktail while we are waiting . Would you tell the hostess to please come and let us know when our table is ready ?"
"I will let her know where you are ."
"The patio tables look really nice . Could we be seated there , please ?"
"I could seat you right away at an outside table if you would like ."
"Thanks ! We'll sit out there then . We will just order our drinks out there ."
"Well , can I start you off with some cocktails while you are looking over the menu ?"
"Yes , why don't you bring us a bottle of the house Chablis with four glasses to start with ?"
"I'll get on that right away !"
"We appreciate your help . "
"Would you like this one ?"
"I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ?"
"This one ?"
"No , the other one ... yes ."
"This one is especially built for hard , continuous play . And every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make it a dependable one for tournament use ."
"It do look beautiful . Well . I think I'll take it.Now do you have any racket covers ?"
"This cover comes with the racket ."
"How much does it come up to ?"
"The mark says six hundred yuan , plus tax , it's six hundred and eighty yuan ."
"Do you accept credit cards ?"
"Sure . If you'll just wait here , I'll be right with you in a minute . "
"Which way is the dining car ?"
"Two cars forward ."
"What time will breakfast be served ?"
"7:00 , sir . "
"It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it !"
"I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into ."
"Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over ."
"How Ay years have you been working with him ?"
"About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes ."
"It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters ."
"Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ?"
"He would be good . "
"Hi , this is Quipu Corp . Is that Miss Zhang ?"
"Yes . speaking . Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"I am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow ."
"What do I need to take with me ?"
"You'd better bring the diploma , identification card and several copies of your resume . "
"I'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . Can you help me ?"
"Sure . We've helped more than ten thousand people buy and sell houses . We're the No . 1 realtor in this community . I recommend this house ( He points at a picture ) ."

"OK . How much is the deposit ?"
"Ten thousand . "
"Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow ."
"That's great . You need to prepare for it ."
"How ?"
"Buy an expensive suit ."
"Is a white shirt OK ?"
"Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . "
"Uh ... that's Greek to me ."
"That means they have tapered legs ."
"Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in ."
"Mine are , too ."
"So maybe we shouldn't go out after all ."
"Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! "
"Good afternoon . Reservations . May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'm calling from Tenga Company . I'd like to know if you have rooms available for the nights from October 8 to October 12 . We are going to have a business conference ."
"May I ask how many people there will be in the party ?"
"20 persons ."
"What kind of room would you like ?"
"Double rooms with twin beds ."
"A moment please , sir . Yes , I can confirm 10 rooms for those days ."
"Thank you . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ?"
"Yes , there is a 10 percent discount ."
"That is fine . "
"Would you like to ask any questions ?"
"I need to know about the fees ."
"What kind of fees ?"
"I ’ m asking about overdraft fees ."
"You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft ."
"What ’ s the fee ?"
"The fee is $ 25 every time you overdraft ."
"How is that a small fee ?"
"That fee should keep you from overdrafting ."
"I ’ ll say ."
"Do you have any more questions ?"
"I don ’ t need to know anything else . Thank you . "
"Could I ask the company for the housing ?"
"Yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters ."
"How will you solve the problem ?"
"The company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month . "
"I would like to book a table for 2 ."
"OK , sir . When will you be there ?"
"7:00 tonight and we'd like a smoking table ."
"No problem , sir . "
"We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters ."
"You need to make posters ?"
"absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas ."
"I see . Then let's make a shoppinglIist first before we go there.othe rise , It may take us a whole day to search for the things you need ."
"No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. , Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon ."
"Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf ."
"Oh , yes . You are so smart . I see them . So I have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes ."
"I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number ."
"It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . "
"Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem ."
"Why is that ?"
"Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home ."
"And the downstairs neighbors ?"
"Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor ."
"Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . "
"Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ?"
"Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end ."
"Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined ."
"Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly ."
"Do you think the trend will continue ?"
"I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point ."
"Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . "
"Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ?"
"Yes . One more is needed ."
"Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it ."
"But do you have any experience like that ?"
"Yes . I have been a guide for two years ."
"OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ?"
"I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip ."
"If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ?"
"No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings ."
"Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company ."
"Thank you . It's my honor . "
"I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed ."
"Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments ."
"You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ?"
"To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on , interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ?"
"That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail , Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ?"
"I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled , So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . "
"What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ?"
"No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species ."
"You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ?"
"The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . "
"Good afternoon.Welcome to China.May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ?"
"Yes , here you are ."
"Thank you.What ' s your occupation , Mr . Smith ?"
"I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation ."
"You are here on business , aren't you ?"
"Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks ."
"I see.Do you have anything to declare ?"
"Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare ."
"Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in ."
"All right . "
"Oh , sir . I lost my passport ."
"Do you remember when and where you last saw it ?"
"I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag ."
"Could you please tell me your passport number ?"
"3448-2691- 6429-34 ."
"And what is the expiration date on your passport ?"
"Five months later ."
"I see . Please fill out this form . And you need to contact your embassy or consulate to report it as soon as possible . "
"Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation ."
"I'm very delighted too . I'm sure that we'll have a wider range of cooperation . So , let's drink to the signing of our contract ."
"Bottoms up !"
"Cheers . "
"Let's go to the cinema by bus ."
"Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient ."
"OK , it will be a new experience for me ."
"We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy ."
"Where do we pay the fare ?"
"Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket ."
"Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?"
"No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . "
"What can I do for you , sir ?"
"I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister ."
"What kind of games do you like ?"
"Big games of course ."
"I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ?"
"Type ? I don't know , what do you have ?"
"Basically , there are 7 types of games , Well , I am a beginner . I ... , Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration ."
"I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games ."
"If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes ."
"Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two ."
"Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive ."
"I will have the latest editions . "
"Excuse me , do you have a vacancy ?"
"Let me see . Yes , we still have four left ."
"Well , I would like to book a single room ."
"How long would you stay ?"
"5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 . "
"Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike !"
"If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy !"
"He sounds like a sick cow !"
"Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key ."
"I already tried that . Nothing seems to help ."
"Hey ! Where are you going ... ? "
"What are you calling about today ?"
"I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow ."
"Is there a problem ?"
"I would like to reschedule ."
"That shouldn't be a problem ."
"Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow ?"
"So , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ?"
"Yes , will that be possible ?"
"What time would you like us to deliver it ?"
"Is 2:30 Okay ?"
"Your delivery has been confirmed ."
"Thank you , and I'm sorry for the change of plans . "
"Did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ?"
"No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses ."
"Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses ."
"I have found I ’ m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses ."
"We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ?"
"I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me ."
"What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on ."
"They fit me very well . I like them ."
"Please go to receive optometry first over there . "
"To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 101 to New York City ?"
"Go to gate 18 . The plane is now boarding . You must hurry ."
"Show me the fastest way to get there ."
"Instead of walking , you can take this shuttle to get you there faster ."
"Do you think the plane will leave without me ?"
"No , I ’ ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ’ re on your way ."
"Thank you so much . I would really appreciate that ."
"You are welcome . Have a safe trip . "
"Will you be voting ?"
"I will . Will you be voting ?"
"Well , when is the election ?"
"You don ’ t know that ?"
"I just don ’ t know ."
"It ’ s this Tuesday ."
"You can ’ t be serious ."
"Why would I joke ?"
"Thanks for telling me ."
"You should ’ Ve known already ."
"I forgot ."
"As long as you go vote , that ’ s all that matters . "
"Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies ."
"Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?"
"I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content ."
"I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are ."
"I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home ."
"Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles ."
"In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?"
"It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit ."
"Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?"
"If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less ."
"It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree ."
"We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year ."
"If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months ."
"That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that "
"Hello ? This is Mike here . May I have a word with Grace ?"
"She ’ s not at her desk at the moment . Is there any message I can give her ?"
"Yes . Please tell her that tickets to Phantom of the Opera will be delivered in two days . My number is 6521684 0 , extension 236 ."
"Ok . I ’ ll let her know as soon as possible ."
"Thanks a lot . Bye . "
"Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ?"
"It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country ."
"Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end ."
"How do you think they could be ended ?"
"I don't think that there is any easy way ."
"I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support ."
"Yeah , you are right ! "
"Mary , why are you so tired ?"
"I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it ."
"Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet ?"
"On the Internet ? I have never tried that way ."
"Well , it's very convenient and very popular now ."
"So how to apply for a job on the Internet ?"
"Just get online and send your application through email to the employer ."
"But how can I know which employer is hiring ?"
"You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website ."
"Will the employers see my information ?"
"Yes . If they think you are a fit , maybe they will contact you ."
"Is it safe to job hunt on the Internet ?"
"If you log in some formal websites , it must be very safe ."
"I will give it a try at once . "
"Stop burping ."
"I can't help it . "
"Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ?"
"It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently ."
"I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ?"
"We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though ."
"If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future ."
"That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . "
"Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview ."
"Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment ."
"We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable ."
"Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places ."
"We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview ."
"In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview ."
"Don't forget to say "" Thank you "" when you take a seat ."
"Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words ."
"You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way ."
"Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment ."
"Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again ."
"Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments . "
"Can I help you , madam ?"
"Yes , can I see a few T-shirts , Please ?"
"Certainly.Here you are.They ' re the very latest fashion ."
"I'm not very particular about the design.But I want something of good quality ."
"They're of good cotton and the color never fades . "
"What's the weather forecast for today ?"
"Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon ."
"Any rain ?"
"No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow ."
"I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . "
"When you smell them , they affect your nervous system ."
"I thought you were supposed to put them in some kind of burner with a candle ... , You can do that , too . Both methods have a healing effect ."
"So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ?"
"Ha-ha ... I'm just fatigued . And tomorrow is a big day ."
"What's tomorrow ?"
"More sales ! "
"Next , please . May I help you , sir ?"
"Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account ."
"Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?"
"What features do they offer ?"
"Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars ."
"I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money ."
"Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that ."
"No , that won ’ t be necessary ."
"In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?"
"Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars . "
"Accounting , this is Mike ."
"Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ?"
"Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar ."
"OK . See you at your office at 2:30 ."
"Right , see you then ! "
"Let ’ s see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew ."
"Ok , every one asks their parents let them stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning ."
"Well , I ’ m not everyone-else ’ s father . I think you need be in the house by ten o ’ clock ."
"That ’ s absurd . I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that ."
"I ’ ll be worried if you stay out late ."
"Ok , how about midnight curfew . and I'll let you know where I am . "
"May I help you ?"
"My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is ."
"What dose she look like ?"
"She has blond hair and blue eyes ."
"What was she wearing ?"
"She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers ."
"When did you last see her ?"
"I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... , How long has it been ?"
"Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . "
"How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits ?"
"Are you working fewer hours than you used to work ?"
"I got laid off ."
"You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours ."
"Do all jobs provide unemployment ?"
"Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t ."
"Do you think that my job pays unemployment ?"
"You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you ."
"Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment ?"
"There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned . They will let you know when you file your claim . "
"Where are you studying and what's your major ?"
"I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law ."
"Why did you choose Beijing University ?"
"Because Beijing University is the best university in China and I'm sure I am one of the best students ."
"What courses have you learned ?"
"I have learned many courses , such as Civil Law , Economic Law , Commercial Law and Administration Law ."
"Which one is your favorite ? Why ?"
"Civil Law . Because it is broad and profound , and furthermore , it best reflects the spirits of fairness and equality ."
"What was your minor subject ?"
"Psychology . "
"Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ?"
"Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one ."
"This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks ."
"That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card ."
"That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post ."
"Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ?"
"May I have your details , and I'll check for you ."
"Certainly ... , OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card ."
"Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . "

"Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ?"
"As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming ."
"Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings ."
"I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills ."
"Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out ."

"I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ?"
"I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it !"
"Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ?"
"Don't worry , I would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , I will be right here to help you out , I can be a translator and tour guide ."
"Thank you very much ."
"My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! "
"Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you ."
"No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me ."
"Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ?"
"All right , I ’ ll put you in my book . "
"Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?"
"Yes , Sir ."
"These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters ."
"All right , who should I send them to ?"
"It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London ."
"Ok , home or office address ?"
"Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive ."
"Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?"
"Yes , it ’ s right . "
"Help me organize these coins ."
"That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ?"
"Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles ."
"Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies ."
"Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank ."
"I found some coins that are not from here ."
"Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound ."
"Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ?"
"Hopefully ! "
"So , are we all ready to go ?"
"Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car ."
"Did you get the camera ?"
"Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ?"
"Yup , it ’ s all set ."
"You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ?"
"I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered ."
"Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips !"
"Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ?"
"But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes ."
"I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . "
"Mary , my friend recommend me for a job to work in a company , and I feel it's great ."
"Really ? Are you familiar with that company ?"
"He has introduced the company details to me ."
"What does the company mainly do ?"
"The company deals in selling electronics ."
"When was the company founded ?"
"It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years ."
"How many employees are there in total in the company ?"
"More than 2000 now ."
"What education background do the employees usually have ?"
"The company deals in selling electronics ."
"When was the company founded ?"
"It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years ."
"How many employees are there in total in the company ?"
"More than 2000 now ."
"What education background do the employees usually have ?"
"More than half of the employees have bachelors ' degree ."
"Are there many promotion chances in the company ?"
"Three times every year ."
"That's great . You can go take a look . "
"Do you have any certificate that has something to do with tourism ?"
"Yes , I have the Tour Guide Certificate ."
"Why do you choose our travel agency ?"
"Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job . "
"May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?"
"Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point ."
"Thank you for telling me that ."
"But remind you , there are some forbidden activities ."
"What are they ? I ’ ll be careful ."
"Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters ."
"I got it ."
"Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed ."
"I see "
"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it ."
"You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea ."
"So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it ."
"It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning "" Thanks "" . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup ."
"So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ?"
"Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal ."
"What does that imply , then ?"
"More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . "
"Hello , Mr . Jones ."
"Hello , Miss Wu ."
"Long time no see . How is everything at home ?"
"Pretty good , thank you . And you ?"
"OK , thanks . Anything I can do for you ?"
"I need to remit £ 500 to London ."
"Yes , sir . Would you like to remit it by M / T or by T / T ?"
"T / T , please ."
"Very well , Mr . Jones . "
"Hello . I'd like to change my reservation for March 19 . My name is Mary Chang ."
"Ah , yes , Miss Chang . What seems to be the problem ?"
"Well , I'd like to change the date to March 20 , and make that for two singles , not one ."
"Very well . That can be arranged . "
"To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later ."
"Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ."
"A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered ."
"Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?"
"Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month ."
"Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home ."
"When will that be ?"
"Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB , You can rest assured of that . "
"I'd like to buy a fridge . What about the quality of higher products ?"
"I strongly recommend it . As an international enterprise , it produces high quality household appliances ."
"Is there a warranty ?"
"Yes , all their products have warranties ."
"How long is it ?"
"The fridges is covered by a one-year warranty ."
"Which model is the best seller of this year ?"
"This one . How do you like it ?"
"It's too big for me . Could you recommend something else ?"
"Sure , this way please . "
"Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ... , Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating ."
"Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ?"
"I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad ."
"Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely ."
"OK . Wish me luck ! "
"I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning ."
"To visit our supplier ?"
"Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers ."
"Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase ."
"Sure ."
"By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?"
"No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me ."
"Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything ."
"I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ?"
"I am not sure . You can check with the finance department ."
"I will call them this afternoon , thanks ."
"You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . "
"Excuse me . Could you tell me if the bus goes the national history museum ?"
"No . It doesn ’ t . There ’ s no through bus to the national history museum Madam .. , I see . Where do I have to change them ?"
"You can transfer at Cuchan Men ."
"How far is it ?"
"Well , it ’ s only three stops from here ."
"I see . Thanks a lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"Which institute did you choose in university ?"
"I chose the Institute of Foreign Language ."
"How many departments were there in your university ?"
"There were a number of them , such as Department of Literation , Department of Journalism and Communication , Department of Art Design , etc . "
"Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ?"
"I should be most delighted ."
"Thank you , Mr . White ."
"Delighted I was able to help . "
"May I see your passport please ?"
"Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form ."
"What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ?"
"Business . I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago ."
"This visa is good for two weeks . Do you intend to stay longer than that ?"
"No . I will fly back twelve days from now ."
"And you will do some traveling while you are here ?"
"Yes , I want to spend a couple days in New York . I have friends there I will visit ."
"What do you have in the bag , Mr . Lee ?"
"Just my cameras , my clothes , and some books ."
"You're not carrying any food with you today ?"
"No ."
"Okay , Mr . Lee . This is just a routine check . Would you mind opening the bag for me ?"
"Alright . "
"I ’ m looking for a budget hotel in Orlando . Have you ever stayed at the Comfort Hotel ?"
"Yes ... I wouldn ’ t recommend it ."
"Why not ?"
"Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests ."
"Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ?"
"Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches ."
"Hmm , I ’ ll pass . Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune . "
"What do you think of this coffee table ?"
"It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room ."
"How about this one ?"
"Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean ."
"Alright , let's look at some others ."
"Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive ."
"Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy . "
"I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer ."
"The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering ?"
"I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ."
"Let ’ s leave some room on this offer . I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market ."
"We could try that , but I really want this house !"
"It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer ."
"How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer ?"
"The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond . They want to get things moving ."
"Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer ?"
"There really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait . You are already pre-qualified for your loan . "
"Hello , how are you ? I am Jack ."
"Hello , I am Amy ."
"What brings you here ?"
"I saw that your Corollas are on sale ."
"Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one ."
"Tell me about Corollas ."
"Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 ."
"Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ?"
"You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere ."
"I am serious . $ 15,000 ."
"Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do ."
"No . Just talk to your manager and let me know ."
"Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 ."
"The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats ."
"You are really tough . You got a deal ."
"Thanks ! "
"What is that plastic cup for ?"
"Your doctor has requested a urine sample ."
"Am I supposed to pee into the cup ?"
"We want what we call a clean sample . Urinate a drop or so into the toilet , and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup ."
"Then what do I do with the cup ?"
"You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby ."
"What is this test for ?"
"He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection ."
"When will I know the results ?"
"Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results . "
"Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees ."
"I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track ."
"Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ?"
"He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . "
"Besides salary what kind of allowance can I expect ?"
"We have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis ."
"Can you elaborate it more concretely ?"
"Yes . Floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount , such as quarterly bonus , bonus at the end of the year . "
"Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S ."
"Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ?"
"Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... , Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ?"
"Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... , Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ?"
"You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . "
"Susan ? We ’ re having a farewell party for John Anderson today ."
"What time ? I ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today ."
"We ’ re starting at 12:00 and it ’ ll go on for the rest of the afternoon ."
"I ’ ll try to make it . I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock . "
"We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?"
"That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ?"
"See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too ."
"Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies ."
"The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is ."
"Do you enjoy working in this office ?"
"Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer ."
"What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ?"
"We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward suggestions and ideas . Be sure to speak up if you have any . "

"Did anyone approach you to ask you to carry anything for them ?"
"No , sir . We left directly from the hostel ."
"Are these four pieces all your luggage ?"
"Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons ."
"You'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons ."
"Right . Thanks ."

"That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week . "
"OK ... well , then how much is one jin ?"
"Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin ."
"30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ?"
"You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT ."
"Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs ."
"I'll have my brother cut some for you ."
"This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ?"
"That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon !"
"Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ?"
"Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life !"
"And how about these little brown chips ?"
"Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? "
"Let ’ s go to Wangfujing by bus ."
"Better take the subway . It ’ s faster , and more convenient ."
"En , where do we pay the fares ?"
"Just go to the ticket office in the subway ."
"Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?"
"No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . "

"That's no problem . There are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . Which service would you like ?"
"I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ?"
"If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service ."
"Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . "

"The aroma of roasting coffee beans ."
"Smells like you're baking something . What are those ?"
"Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them ."

"It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ?"
"There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway ."
"The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... , No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro ."
"Is it expensive to ride on the underground ?"
"You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go ."
"Is it easy to get lost ?"
"No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . "
"Where are you employed ?"
"I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company ."
"What do you think of your present job ?"
"I find it interesting ."
"How do you get to office ?"
"I go to the office by bus every day ."
"What does your work consist of exactly ?"
"My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees ."
"Would you mind working overtime at night ?"
"No , often my boss requires overtime work ."
"How much money are you making a month ?"
"5,000 yuan a month ."
"Why do you plan to change your job ?"
"I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . "
"Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ?"
"Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ?"
"My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check ."
"Did you work at all during the last pay period ?"
"Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money ."
"Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ?"
"Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form ."
"Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check ."
"Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then ."
"That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . "
"I ’ m not sure what you expect me to do , Michelle . You ’ Ve not been very clear about any of this ."
"I ’ m sorry , Clint . Maybe I didn ’ t make myself clear enough . We should get together to discuss this ."
"Yeah . I think that would be a good idea . I ’ m really in the dark on everything ."
"Fine . Let ’ s meet this afternoon . I ’ ll draw you a better picture of the situation . "
"Hi . I want to open an account with you , so I can pay my bills by direct debit ."
"That's a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free !"
"Yes , that's what I thought . It's so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . So , what exactly do I need to do ?"
"Please fill in this application and sign your name down here , at the bottom ."
"Here you go . Is that it ?"
"I just need to see some ID , like a passport for example ."
"Here . What's the least I can pay in to get this account open ?"
"We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir ."
"OK , here you go ."
"So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days . "
"First of all , thank you for accepting this job ."
"It ’ s my pleasure ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ?"
"We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ?"
"They sum my skills and experience . I ’ d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month ."
"That sounds reasonable ."
"Do I have paid vacation ?"
"Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager . "
"why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?"
"well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight ."
"what are they ?"
"one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families ."
"why ?"
"the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis ."
"that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper ."
"and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat ."
"what's that ?"
"nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !"
"wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising ."
"yeah , I guess so ."
"you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise ."
"hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds ."
"so what happened ?"
"well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds ."
"you should have kept trying . "
"Has my package arrived ?"
"I'm not sure . What does it look like ?"
"It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal ."
"There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . "
"Excuse me , sir . Didn't you see the red light ?"
"Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here ."
"No , sir . The sign says No Turn on Red ."
"Oh , I guess I didn't see it ."
"I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket ."
"Here they are ."
"Sign here , PLS . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Pls drive safely , sir ."
"Thank you , Ma ’ am . "
"Who has been here already this morning ?"
"Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com ."

"Elvin stopped by to see me ."
"Elvin ? Which one is he ? "

"Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ?"
"I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's , They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy ."
"That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?"
"Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go , That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night ."
"Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too ."
"That does sound a lot of fun . "
"Are you OK there ?"
"Oh , my computer crashed again !"

"That would be great ! I hate working with computers !"
"Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . "
"Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?"
"Good day . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment today ."
"Certainly . How much rent did you want to pay ?"
"Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 900 a month ."
"$ 900 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartment as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today , on Eleventh Avenue . It ’ s near the municipal buildings ."
"Is it furnished ?"
"No , it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but there are not many cookers . There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it . The landlord lives downstairs . Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 ... , No , thank you ! I want to take an apartment , not a prison ."
"Ok , we would do as your requirement . And we ’ ll contact with you later ! "
"Hello . What can we do for you ?"
"Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan ."
"Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ?"
"Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate ."
"Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... , Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . "
"Is Tom here ?"
"Speaking . "
"Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor ."
"Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ?"
"I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at ."
"Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ?"
"No , but I have a low fever ."
"I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ?"
"I want to come in on Wednesday ."
"I can fit you in on that day at 10 , I would prefer Dr . Smith ."
"You can see the doctor of your choice then , and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time . "
"Good morning , Star Airline . What can I do for you ?"

"I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned ."
"Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . "
"I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week ."
"What is it ?"
"I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged ."
"Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port ."
"Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases ."
"Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route ."
"Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately ."
"We will check with the parties concerned right away . "
"Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ?"

"Fine , thanks . I will go to Mainland China for a business trip tomorrow , and I want to change some Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi ."
"How much do you want , Mr.Chen ?"
"One thousand yuan , please . By the way , what is today's exchange quotation ?"
"The rate is still high for other foreign currencies . The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi is 1.053 Renminbi yuan to one dollar ."
"Oh , I see . Could you please split the one thousand Renminbi into hundreds and tens ?"
"Certainly , sir . How do you want it ?"
"Five hundred in hundred RIB notes and the others in ten RIB notes , please ."
"Yes , Mr.Chen . Here you are ."
"Thank you very much . "
"Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?"
"I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ?"
"Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel ."
"Anything that can keep my skin clean will do ."
"How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy ."
"Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance ."
"We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it ."
"I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ?"
"Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic ."
"I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later ."
"Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . "
"This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting ."
"I didn't know you did Yoga ."
"I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it ."
"What have you learned ?"
"Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly ."
"As opposed to short and shallow ?"
"Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' , I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' "
"Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting ."
"What is it , Mrs . Wang ?"
"It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them ."
"Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ?"
"Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable ."
"Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage ."
"The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing ."
"As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export ."
"I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss ."
"The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment ."
"We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage ."
"That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage ."
"To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us ."
"Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case ."
"Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . "
"Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?"
"Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it ."
"I think I can handle it by myself ."
"I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company ."
"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility ."
"Other company rules also need your attention ."
"Like this one ?"
"Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder ."
"Yeah , thank you for telling me ."
"Don ’ t mention it . "
"Order !"
"Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea ."
"What ’ s your plea ?"
"I am pleading not guilty ."
"But all the evidence points to you ."
"I am not the guilty party , What are you saying ?"
"I am not the person who committed that crime ."
"Who is ?"
"Will you let me go if I tell you ?"
"We can work something out ."
"I have no problem singing like a canary . "
"Hi , Alex . How are you doing ?"
"Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work !"
"I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner ."
"I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? "
"Hello sir , how may I help you ?"
"I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice ."
"I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?"
"It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry ."
"Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness ."
"I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?"
"Mmm , well this is our “ I ’ m sorry I cheated on you ” package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you ."
"I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !"
"I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?"
"Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier ."
"Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
"That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ?"
"Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her ."
"I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered ."
"He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that ."
"Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?"
"I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair ."
"We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself ."
"Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?"
"No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ?"
"Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend ."
"I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . "
"Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ?"
"Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ?"
"An acoustic one ."
"Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ?"
"What ’ s the difference ?"
"Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords ."
"I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar ."
"In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation ."
"This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one ."
"In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play ."
"Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well ."
"You should also get a couple of guitar picks ."
"Oh , right.Thanks for your help ."
"Don ’ t mention it . "
"Is Mr . Thomas there , please ?"
"Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ?"
"I said , is Mr . Thomas there ?"
"Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line . "
"Would you like to make a donation ?"
"Donations for what ?"

"How much money are you trying to raise ?"
"It doesn ’ t matter how much ."
"What are you doing to raise money ?"
"We go door to door asking for donations ."
"You should try other fundraisers ."
"Like what ?"
"You can always wash cars and sell candy ."
"That ’ s a great idea ."
"That ’ ll help you make more money . "
"Hello , this is Rich ."
"Hi , Rich . Is Jim here ?"
"He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?"
"Sure . This is Claire ."
"Does have your telephone number ?"
"No , it ’ s 3725019281 ."
"3725015281 ?"
"No , it ’ s 3725019281 , it ’ s a 9 , not a 5 ."
"Right . I ’ ll have him call you back ."
"Can you tell him that it ’ s urgent ?"
"Sure can ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"No problem ."
"Bye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Here we are , Room 215 ."

"May I have your name , please ?"
"Michael ."
"OK , Sir . We will arrange it for you . "
"Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ?"
"We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities ."
"What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ?"
"Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . "
"But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment ."
"Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge ."
"Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ?"
"This balcony is perfect for barbecuing ."
"And we could get a dog !"
"I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish ."
"Well , fish it will be then . "
"John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news !"

"Where are we going now ?"
"We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park ."
"Where is it ?"
"It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing ."
"What can we see in it ?"
"Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing ."
"Anything else ?"
"According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called "" Coal Hill "" . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 ."
"Tragedy ."
"Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . "
"What's the specialty of your restaurant ?"
"The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers ."

"OK . I will follow your advice . "
"Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules ."

"What are they ?"
"They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder ."
"And what is the most important point ?"
"You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . "
"Good day , what can I do for you ?"
"Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ?"
"Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ?"
"Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia ."
"That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent ."
"That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks . "
"If you'd like further information on this , there ’ s a guidebook in several languages on sale at the information desk ."
"Do you have a Chinese edition of this ?"
"I'm afraid we don't . Won't an English edition do ?"
"I'll try to read one . "
"You sure are buying a lot of things online ."
"Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks ."
"What are the advantages of buying online ?"
"Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun ."
"The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . "
"What did you exactly do there ?"
"I was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet ."
"What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ?"
"They are sense of post , mentality quality , first aid ability , emergency adjustment , and law consciousness . "

"Very short time . I became an auditor within three months . "
"How are your stocks doing , Jim ?"
"Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good ."
"Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too ."
"Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas ."
"I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now ."
"Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ?"
"No . What happened ?"
"He lost his kids ’ college money by trading ."
"Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that . "

"Great . Send it to me by FedEx tomorrow morning . Or better , call Federal Express for a pick-up . That way I'll get it even earlier ."
"That'll cost me a fortune ."
"Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package ."
"OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service ."

"I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ?"

"No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition ."
"Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ?"
"Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago ."
"We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers ."
"Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?"
"First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves ."
"I see . What else ?"
"We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones ."
"Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money ."
"Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . "
"Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ?"
"My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go ."
"That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan ."
"Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ?"
"What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us ."
"Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ?"
"Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course ."
"What do you require ?"
"A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment ."
"That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . "
"What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?"
"First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations ."
"That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff ."
"I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ?"
"Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD ."
"Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?"
"The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?"
"Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month ."
"When will the branch office open ?"
"Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly ."
"Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?"
"Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine ."

"Do you have an account with us ?"
"Yeah . Here's my identification card ."
"Do you want large or small bills ?"
"Actually , I want to buy some traveler's checks ."
"What denomination ?"
"Twenties would be fine ."
"Do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ?"
"Yes , please . "
"Jim , what do you think of that first interviewee ?"
"Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy ."
"Okay , what about the first woman ?"
"She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills ."
"All right , and what about the older gentle ?"
"He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified ."
"Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job ."
"Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . "
"Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ?"
"Sure , Emily . How can I help you ?"
"I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ?"

"Maintenance Department . May I come in ?"
"Come in , please ."
"Did you call us ?"
"Yes . The television is not working properly ."

"Let me have a look . I think the batteries should be changed . Let me replace them with new ones . Now , it's working ."
"That's great ."
"Is there anything else I can do for you ?"
"No , thanks ."
"If you have any problems , just call us ."
"OK . Thank you . "
"Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party ."
"Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ?"

"Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . "
"May I help you ?"
"Give me six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fries , and a large coke ."
"You will need to wait a few minutes for fries . They're still in the fryer ."
"That's fine ."
"Your total comes to 7 dollars ."
"Here's 20 ."
"Thank you . Your cash back is 13 dollars . Pull into a parking states , and we'll bring you your fries in two minutes ."
"Thanks . "
"have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ?"
"no , what's it about ?"
"apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity ."
"she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young ."
"I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world ."
"I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base ."
"you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa ."
"did they mention that in the article ?"
"yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary ."
"that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has ."
"I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels ."
"it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room !"
"what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . "
"What kind of jobs have you had ?"
"I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China ."
"How did your previous employers treat you ?"
"They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other ."
"What have you learned from the jobs you have had ?"
"I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager ."
"When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ?"
"I prefered working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them . "
"Excuse me , sir . Can you tell me where I can buy some chocolates ?"

Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece ."
"Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ?"
"We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her ."
"Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... , Perhaps you could give her a ring ?"
"Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous ."
"Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !"
"Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question !"

"If my plans don't change , I'll need a room April 14 till April 17 ."
"Sir , our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought . Will that be okay ?"
"Tell me how much it will be , and I can tell you if it's okay ."
"Only $ 308 per night , before taxes , of course ."
"$ 308 a night ? That's a fair price ."
"Now , as for the room , sir , do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?"
"Nonsmoking , please ."
"Nonsmoking . Now , sir , does a single queen-size bed meet your approval ?"
"I have absolutely no problem with that ."
"Queen , nonsmoking . Okay , sir , your room is reserved . Now if you'll just give me your phone number ."
"Not a problem . The number is 626-555-1739 ."
"Thank you for making a reservation with us . We look forward to seeing you in April ! "
"Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ?"
"Sure , what's up ?"
"Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice ."
"Really ? Why ?"
"Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go ."
"But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company ."
"Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company ."
"Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ?"
"Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it ."
"Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier ."
"Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go ."
"Sure . "
"The May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ?"
"I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures ."
"Where are you planning on going ?"
"I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ?"
"I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there ."
"Would you recommend going there for a few days ?"
"Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital ."
"You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ?"
"It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ?"
"I ’ d like to get away from the big city life ."
"Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing ."
"I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away ."
"Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number ."
"Thanks , I ’ ll give them a call later . "
"Jack , do say good-bye for me to the host . I've got to run ."
"Why are you in such a hurry ?"
"My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye !"
"Bye ! "
"Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in ."
"I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year ."
"Perfect ! I like this one ."
"That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission ."
"Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?"
"It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway ."
"That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?"
"A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !"
"Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?"
"Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back ."
"Great ! Let ’ s do it ! "
"Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ?"
"Let me check . It has a paper jam ."
"I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out ."
"Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . "
"I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting A-l quality ."
"I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality ."
"We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits ."
"Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want ."
"Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning ."
"Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . "
"sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this ."
"What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ?"
"It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board ."
"I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ? "
"We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you ."
"Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ?"
"That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear ."
"How long will the tour take ?"
"It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour ."
"Okay ... , Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... "
"I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure ."
"You ? You are full of hot air . "
"Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ’ s on your mind ?"
"Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty ."
"Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours ."
"OK , I completely understand . "
"Credit Services , how can I help you ?"
"I'd like to apply for a credit card with you ."
"Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ?"
"Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ?"
"Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB ."
"Why such a big difference ?"
"It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card ."
"My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ?"
"Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts ."
"That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . "
"Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use ."
"Can I take a look at one of those ?"
"Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges ."
"Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing ."
"Sure , Just push the button , like ... , I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' , I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today ."
"I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . "
"good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?"
"well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?"
"first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs ."
"how can you get that done ?"
"well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan ."
"what else ?"
"since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us , sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?"
"that depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year ."
"perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first ."
"wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it ."
"OK , I'll take it . "
"May I see that ivory horse ?"
"Of course ."
"It's genuine , I bet ."
"It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan ."
"I'll take it . "
"Have you been taken care of ?"
"Not yet . I am looking for a black suitcase ."
"Is there any special brand you'd like ?"
"Yes . I would prefer Nike ."
"The franchised store is on the second floor ."
"Thank you . "
"Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ?"
"Let me just park my car in a better position . Alright , miss . Where ’ s the luggage ?"
"Over there . "
"Can I make a reservation ?"
"Yes , sir . For what time ?"
"7 o'clock tonight and there will be 5 persons ."
"OK , sir . Five persons at 7:00 ."
"Do you have a VIP room ?"
"Sorry , sir . We have only tables in the main dinning room left . "
"Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ?"
"Yes ."
"I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office ."
"Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time ."
"Ok , see you then , bye ."
"Bye . "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes . I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation ."
"How long do you have ?"
"1 week . Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there ?"
"New York is full of place of interest , such as Times Square , Broadway , Wall street and Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty ."
"That's fantastic . "
"You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast ."
"I agree . And it's very convenient ."
"Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail ."
"Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time ."
"Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! "
"Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ?"
"Yes ."
"You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference ."
"I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four ."
"All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ?"
"Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ?"
"The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here ."
"Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students ."
"I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer ."
"Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory ."
"Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?"
"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?"
"History ."
"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price ."
"Thirty percent ?"
"Yes ."
"Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?"
"Yes . It's an excellent system ."
"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?"
"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing ."
"I don't want Macintosh . I want PC ."
"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment ."
"What ? Are you serious ?"
"Yes ."
"But nobody uses Macintosh !"
"That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ?"
"Yes , I'm from Taiwan ."
"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used ."
"But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese ."
"There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple ."
"Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry ."
"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple ."
"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later ."
"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . "
"What kind of jobs have you had ?"
"I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the food market in China ."
"How did your previous employers treat you ?"
"They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other ."
"What have you learned from the jobs your have had ?"
"I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager ."
"When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ?"
"I preferred working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can ’ t do without them . "
"My name is Steven Smith and I'm calling to cancel my plane ticket ."
"When was your reservation ?"
"It ’ s 7 p . m . today ."
"Would you mind telling me the reason ?"
"I need to continue to deal with my business . I haven ’ t finished it yet ."
"Oh , I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another time ?"
"No . Thank you ."
"But you have to pay the fee for refund ."
"OK . I will pay it by my bank card . "
"Hi . How can I help you ?"
"I ’ m looking for a job . Are you hiring ?"
"Yes , we are . What position are you looking for ?"
"Superintendent ."
"I ’ m sorry . The application for this position has closed ."
"Do you have any other positions available ?"
"We have only one position open ."
"What is it ?"
"Gas Meter Reader . This is a wonderful job for the right person , regular hours , no night shifts , no supervisor behind you , and good pay ."
"Can I apply for it right now ?"
"Sure . "
"Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up ."
"No kidding ! When did that happen ?"
"Early this morning ."
"Oh , no ."
"Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that ."
"Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ?"
"The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition ."
"That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! "
"Are you OK there ?"
"Oh , my computer crashed again !"
"Can I help ?"
"That would be great ! I hate working with computers !"
"Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . "
"What's combined transportation ?"
"If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' ."
"Why is it necessary ?"
"It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . "
"So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ?"
"I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do ."
"Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these "" other people "" make ?"
"Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing ."
"Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more ."
"That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ?"
"I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget , That would be very good of you , Mr . White . "
"I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need !"
"What are you getting ?"
"Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker ."
"Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it ."
"Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies ."
"I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter ."
"That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! "
"Do you need any help ?"
"I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ?"
"I like xeroxing ."
"Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with ."
"OK , I will get right to that ."
"I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ?"
"I just started working here ."
"I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ?"
"I'd like to , but I am very busy ."
"I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future . Thanks for the help ! "
"Personal Loans , how may I help ?"
"I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan ."
"Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply , Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?"
"Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse ."
"I see . What about age limitations ?"
"There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age ."
"Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . "
"Hello , how can I help ?"
"Hello there . I need to buy some foreign currency for a business trip . How much can I exchange ?"
"That does depend on where you plan to travel . If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . If your destination is elsewhere , we can exchange up to 2,000 USD ."
"OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now ."
"OK , I'll process that for you now . "
"What ’ s wrong ?"
"I got laid off today ."
"Oh no ! That ’ s terrible !"
"Yeah ."
"What happened ?"
"My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well ."
"What are you going to do ?"
"I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position . "
"You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking ."
"Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager ."
"I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ?"
"No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . "
"Excuse me , what time do you expect to land in Berlin ?"
"We should be there by 5 this afternoon ."
"Do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs ?"
"Well , it all depends on traffic from other arriving aircraft . "
"Where did you work as a teacher before ?"
"I taught English in a primary school in Beijing ."
"What teaching experience have you had ?"
"I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself . "
"Do you have wake-up service ?"
"Yes.You can use the computer to seta tima.Dial 10 and then time.For example.if you want to get up at 7:15 , you can dial 100715 ."
"OK . I understand ."
"Or we can call you tomorrow coming ."
"Well , I would prefer you to call me up tomorrow at 6:30 , No problem . Good night . "
"Front Desk , may I help you ?"
"Yes , I'd like to move to another room ."
"Is there anything uncomfortable in your room ?"
"Yes . The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work ."
"May I have your room number , sir ?"
"Wang Wei . Room 1212 ."
"OK . Mr . Wang , may I send a room attendant to check it for you first ?"
"All right ."
"( 15 minutes later ) Mr . Wang , we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience . The maintenance might last for a long time , may I offer you another room ?"
"Yes . No problem . "
"Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ?"
"Yes , I have found three companies ."
"Have you called to inquire about the positions ?"
"Yes , but the results are not so satisfying ."
"What's the matter ?"
"I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone ."
"What a pity !"
"The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue ."
"It's frustrating !"
"The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates ."
"Wonder why they do that !"
"I feel terrible now ."
"Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually ."
"Thanks for your support and care . "
"Well , this is certainly a nice place , Mr . Taylor . What sort of public transportation is nearby ?"
"Please , call my John . Well , there ’ s a subway stop and bus station just around the corner . Do you have children ?"
"Yes , two ."
"Well , in that case , the schools in this area are very good ."
"We send our kids to private school , but that ’ s good to know too ."
"Oh , well . As far as other conveniences in the neighborhood , there ’ s a grocery store just up the block , and there ’ s lots of little shops nearby ."
"Great . Well , we ’ ll have to think about it , but the place looks great ."
"Here ’ s my card , just give me a call if you ’ re interested . "
"Wow , this is the famous Empire State Building ."
"It's huge ."
"Would you like to go to the top ?"
"Yes , of course ."
"The view is breathtaking . "
"Hmm . You have three cameras . Are you a photographer ?"
"No , my company makes cameras.Well , I'm also a photographer , but two of these are for our display ."
"I see . And what's in this bag ?"
"Egg tarts ."
"I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today ."
"I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables ."
"I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these ."
"Confiscate ?"
"Yes , we will have to dispose of them ."
"It's too bad . They are very delicious ."
"I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands ."
"Oh , well . Not by me ."
"No , not today at least . Enjoy your visit to the United States , Mr . Lee ."
"Thank you . "
"That way they look longer ."
"Now what are you doing ?"
"Putting on mascara ."
"Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes ."
"I won't ."
"And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . "
"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?"
"I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired ."
"Late night ?"
"Yeah , I got home around two . "
"I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate ."
"Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago ."
"What did you take as your major in college ?"
"I took Accounting as my major ."
"What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ?"
"I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue ."
"All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ?"
"There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible ."
"Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things ."
"Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . "
"Johnny , are you just sitting around again ?"
"I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet ."
"I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful !"
"I'm doing my best , Grandma ... , Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !"
"Uh-oh , here we go ... "
"Have you been feeling OK lately ?"
"My coach wants you to check my blood pressure ."
"Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ?"
"I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure ."
"People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer ."
"What test do you do for high blood pressure ?"
"We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading ."
"When you get the reading , what information does it give you ?"
"It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest ."
"I am hoping that this test goes well for me . "
"Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?"
"Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers ."
"Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?"
"Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion ."
"I didn ’ t pay attention to that . "
"I have been getting headaches almost every day lately ."
"Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?"
"I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them ."
"Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?"
"My mother just passed away last Tuesday ."
"I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ?"
"I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority ."
"Have you bumped your head or fallen lately ?"
"No , I haven ’ t hit my head ."
"I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests . "
"Daniel . Mind your eye !"
"I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . "
"OK darling , I got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese !"
"Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food !"
"Humph ! Right , so what did you get ?"
"Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... , Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?"
"They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ... , Oh , so organic vegetables are the ‘ green ’ option , right ?"
"Yup , better for the environment and better for us !"
"Wait a minute , what's that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ?"
"I like doughnuts . "

"Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ?"
"There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there ."
"Are the reports favorable ?"
"Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese ."
"That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ?"
"Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week ."
"I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them ."

"You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom , and the lab tech will get it from the other side ."
"What is my doctor testing me for ?"
"If there are bacteria in your urine , it could mean an infection somewhere ."
"Will I know the results right away ?"

"I ’ m going to down town ."
"At this time ? Why don ’ t you go there tomorrow ? It is almost dark ."
"My boy wants me to buy a toy , so I think I ’ d better satisfy him ."
"But I have seen many toys in your home ."
"There is none now because he likes to destroy toys ."
"But if he always destroys toys and asks you to buy new ones , what will you do ?"

"And you still buy him new ones ?"
"Yes , I think so ."
"You will spoil him . "
"How do you choose which companies to work with ?"

We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . "
"Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ?"

"This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ?"
"This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular ."
"Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . "

"Yes , sometimes . I don't like working nights I have problems sleeping during the day . "
"Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ?"
"I'm not sure . What's the difference ?"
"Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?"
"Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends ."
"Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more . "
"Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I & , NO !"
"I haven't even told you what it is yet !"
"Okay , okay , what do you want ?"

"No can do ... sorry ."
"Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?"
"No way !"
"That ’ s so unfair ! "
"What ’ s up ?"
"I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ?"
"Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?"
"Of course not , I appreciate that ."
"Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity ."
"I see . What can I do now ?"
"You can send a compressed one . "
"Come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , Mary ."
"What is it ?"
"When you go out with friends , I don't want you to stay out too late ."
"Okay ."
"We maintain a curfew for Cindy because she's just 16 ."
"How late can we stay out ?"
"You can stay out till 10 p . m ."
"But if we're going to be late ?"
"Then you call me or Tom first . "
"so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?"
"yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all ."
"that's the Return of the King , right ?"
"yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ?"
"I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me ."
"did you read the books before you watched the movies ?"
"no . did you ?"
"yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters ."
"yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me ."
"I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home ."
"most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles ."
"that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries ."
"I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars ."
"actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! "
"How may I help you ?"
"A double cheeseburger sounds good ."

"Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre ."
"Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts ."
"Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip ."
"Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ?"
"Half an hours later . "
"Hi ! What are you watching ?"
"It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting ."
"Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?"
"They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj ."
"Why do they go there ?"
"Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith ."
"When muslims pray , they face towards mecca ."
"That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed ."
"I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone ."
"That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents ."
"Pilgrimages are common in many faiths ."
"Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages ."
"Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?"
"I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there ."
"Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?"
"Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . "
"Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions ."
"I hope they ’ re not too hard !"
"Well , why should we hire you ?"
"I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company ."
"Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ?"
"I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now ."
"Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO ."
"Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . "

"Then have you received any award at your present company ?"

"They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague ."
"Can you get recommendations from your present employers ?"
"Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are ."
"Do you have any questions ?"
"I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . "
"What are your terms of sale ?"
"The price quoted is for CIF ."
"My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy ."
"Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy ."
"Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker ."
"Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . "
"Excuse me , can you tell me where the breakfast cereals are ?"
"They're in aisle 2A , down that way ."

"How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ?"
"Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer ."
"How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States ?"
"I will go to the bank , give them my check , show them one piece of my identifications , and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check ."
"It sounds quite simple . Next time when I travel abroad , I will apply for this kind of check too . "

"If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw ."
"Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . "

"Bill payment , please . I'd like to pay my electricity bill . I heard there's a new way ; I'm sick and tired of all this queuing !"
"Now , you can do it via our Atms . It's convenient and easy to use . And we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long ."
"So , how do I use it ?"
"You just simply follow the instructions on the screen . You can inquire about your account information and use the self-service payment function . "
"Hi , this is Ralph Simmons . With whom am I speaking ?"
"This is Paula Blake , Mr . Simmons . How can I help you ?"
"I ’ m hoping you can sort a few things out for me . Could you pull up my account ?"
"Certainly , sir . Just tell me your account number please . "
"Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?"
"Sure , let's take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original ."
"Thanks ."
"I can tell you worked hard on it ."
"I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago ."
"Well , it was definitely worth all the time ."
"Let's just hope my teacher agrees . "
"I'd like to speak to Robert ."
"Speaking ."
"Hello , Robert . This is Frank . I'm coming to Guangzhou on the the 7th and I'd like to call in to discuss the project plan ."
"All right . What time are you coming ?"
"Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m ."
"and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ?"
"Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 ."
"Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together ."
"Great . I'll see you on the 7th . "
"I'd like to rent a car ."
"May I see your driver's license , please ?"
"Here is my international driver's license . What kinds of cars do you have ?"
"We have Honda , Citroen and Toyota . Which make and model do you prefer ?"
"I'll take the Citroen C2 . What is the rate for the car per day ?"
"The price is 60 euro per day . Do you want insurance ?"
"Full coverage , please ."
"That's an extra 10 euro a day ."
"Do I have to fill up when I check in ?"
"Yes . "
"Hello , may I speak to Mr . Robert the Human Resources Manager ?"
"Wait a minute . I will get him here . Sorry , he is busy doing something . Why don't you give him a ring later ?"
"OK , that's fine . Thank you ."
"You are welcome . "
"What's your expected salary ?"
"I expect to be paid according to my abilities ."
"How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus ."
"That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience ."
"That sounds very reasonable ."
"By the way , how long is my probation ?"
"Generally it is 6 months and during this period you are half-paid . "
"Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ?"
"A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation ."
"What are the purposes of contract ?"
"In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc ."
"When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ?"
"Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation ."
"You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right ."
"I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week ."
"OK ."
"I will give a call . "
"Good afternoon . Can I help you ?"
"Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ?"
"I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ?"
"I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents ."
"Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir ."
"Do you need anything else from me ?"
"We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card ."
"No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some ."
"The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well ."
"I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . "
"Hello , this is Wal-mart . Can I help you ?"
"Hello . What time do you close , please ?"
"We close at 10:00 every day . And we open at 9:00 in the morning ."
"Oh . Ok . And are you open on the weekends ?"
"Same hours as on the weekdays ."
"Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ?"
"Yes , it runs till the end of the month . But things are clearing out fast ."
"Ok , I'll come down tonight . Thanks ."
"Thank you for calling . "
"What are the best places to visit here please ?"
"It depends If you are interested in the city.you might like to tour it by car I can be your guide , We'll leave the afternoon free.You can do some shopping in the mall if you like ."
"Great . What do you suggest we see ?"
"I suggest we visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art first , Now let's go.look people are jogging along the river.Here we are ."
"The exhibits are really special . I enjoy the paintings very much ."
"So do I . This is Broadway.There are lots of theaters . This way leads to Times Square . "
"Hello , Mr . Macmillan ."
"Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ?"
"Much better , thanks ."
"Glad to hear it . "
"Hey , The Cosby Show is on !"
"The Cosby Show ? Wasn't it over many years ago ?"
"That's right ."
"So how come it's still playing ?"
"I'm watching reruns of it ."
"Reruns ?"
"That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom . "
"You look really wiped out ."
"I had meetings back to back all morning . Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation , and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office ."
"Not a good day , I hate to tell you that Mr . Emory wants to see the designs for the Polish Paste Ad tomorrow morning ."
"I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight ! "
"What is the most enjoyable part about your job ?"
"I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job ."
"What do you find annoying ?"
"Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . "
"Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ?"
"The mangoes are on sale today ."
"What exactly are mangoes ?"
"They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed ."
"Is the seed edible ?"
"Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it ."
"How much does a mango cost ?"
"Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each ."
"Maybe I won't like the taste ."
"It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of citrusy ."
"How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?"
"They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe ."
"Where do most of them come from ?"
"These are from Mexico . "
"Professor , excuse me , but I need to leave early ."
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"I am not feeling well ."
"What is bothering you ?"
"I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack ."
"Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ?"
"No , I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there ."
"Do you need a ride home ?"
"I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK ."
"OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments . "
"Mr . Smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next Wednesday ."
"I'll put them in my schedule . Are there any other messages ?"
"Oh , yes , Miss Chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to July 11 and I've marked your diary accordingly ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"Here is the agenda for the meeting and that's all for the messages . "
"Hello . I need to reserve a room ."
"Not a problem . May I have your name , please ?"
"Of course . I'm John Sandals ."
"Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ?"
"Right now . I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th ."
"Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ?"
"Maybe . How much is a room ?"
"The price per night is $ 308 ."
"That sounds fine to me ."
"Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?"
"I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking ."
"That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ?"
"That'll be no problem ."
"I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number ."
"Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 ."
"626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals . "
"Did you vote ?"
"Of course !"
"Who was your vote for President ?"
"My vote was for Barack Obama ."
"I didn ’ t expect him to win ."
"I had no doubt in my mind that he would win ."
"What made you think that ?"
"Nobody could compete with him ."
"I thought his race would have kept him from winning ."
"Times are changing ."
"That ’ s true ."
"I support our new President 100 % . "
"This computer isn't working properly ."
"I told you so . I kept having problems with it yesterday . I don't know what's wrong ."
"We need to get it fixed soon . "
"Caroline Menzies speaking ."
"Could I speak to Diana Curzon ?"
"I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ?"
"This is John Laing from Dantons ."
"Can I take a message , Mr Laing ?"
"Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called ."
"Certainly . Does she have your number ?"
"She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 ."
"01705 ... , 455623 ."
"455623 ."
"That's right ."
"OK . I'll make sure she gets the message ."
"Thank you . "
"What're you doing now ?"
"I'm watching TV ."
"You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed ."
"I will ."
"And don't ever forget it . "
"What are your strengths and weaknesses ?"
"As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect ."
"What is your problem in working ?"
"I am too introverted to let others become my friends . "
"Hello again . Have you come to a decision ?"
"I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ?"
"Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up ."
"Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ?"
"Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution ."
"So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ?"
"Technically , yes ."
"OK , I think I've got it . "
"Hey Mei Hong , how are you getting to Xi ’ an next week ?"
"I ’ m not sure yet . I may take the train but then again I might take the bus ."
"Yeah but the bus takes a long time . You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days ."
"Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then ."
"Ok well , you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you ."
"Ok . Thanks for that ! "
"Can I help you , sir ?"
"Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife ."
"What kind of presents do you want ?"
"Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ?"
"OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America ."
"Hey , How did you know I came from America ?"
"Just a hunch , sir ."
"How much again ?"
"$ 59.95 ."
"That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs ."
"Sorry , sir ."
"Why not ?"
"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife ."
"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume ."
"That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY ."
"DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml ."
"It's $ 60 here ."
"That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ?"
"Of course not , sir ."
"OK , I'll take one . "
"I see by your resume that you have been working ?"
"Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company ."
"Tell me what you know about our company , please ."
"Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1.5 billion dollars in capital.it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada ."
"What do you know about our major products and our share of the market ?"
"Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China . So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well ."
"What made you decide to change your job ?"
"Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges ."
"Do you like this job ?"
"Yes , I like it very much ."
"What do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ?"
"I think it is confidence in himself and his products ."
"I agree with you . Do you have any questions to ask about this job ?"
"Yes , I'd like to know something about the salary ."
"I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales ."
"When can I get the final decision ?"
"We cannot reach a final decision until we have talked to all of the other five applicants . Anyhow , we'll contact you within this month . All right . Nice meeting you . Good-bye ."
"Nice meeting you , too . Good-bye . "
"Peter , it's time to eat breakfast ."
"I am brushing my teeth ."
"Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming ."
"Mom ~ the toothpaste dropped on my shorts ."
"Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts . "
"Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating ."
"So , what changed ?"
"Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer ."
"Wow , a real step up !"
"Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term ."
"I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ?"
"I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . "
"Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai , China ? It contains only books ."
"You might send it as'Printed Matter ' ."
"I wonder if I could have it insured here ?"
"Of course . How much would you want to insure these books for ?"
"Let me see ... I think I can have them insured for five hundred dollars ."
"Five hundred dollars , so you pay ten dollars for the insurance , that's two percent of the total value of the article ."
"Here's a check for ten dollars . "
"What time does the next train to London leave ?"
"At 16:35 , from platform 8 ."
"Is it a direct train to London ?"
"No , you have to change trains at Birmingham ."
"I see . One ticket to London , please ."
"Single or return , sir ?"
"Single , please ."
"64 pounds , please ."
"Here you are ."
"Here's your ticket and change , sir . "
"Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all ."
"Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring ."
"OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ?"
"Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi ."
"Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course ."
"Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ?"
"No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish ."
"I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ?"
"Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand ."
"Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ?"
"That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay ."
"Let's see . The label says it's got "" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . "" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now ."
"It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely ."
"All right . What varietal is that ?"
"Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess ."
"And you think this is a good wine ?"
"Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma ."
"Perfect ! I'll take it ! "
"I was really glad to hear about your promotion . Congratulations !"
"Thanks , Jane . I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there ."
"Sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !"
"Thanks a lot ."
"You are always responsible and careful ."
"Jane , I appreciate it very much . I expect to see you get nominated pretty soon , too . You've been doing some great work !"
"Thank you . I'll try my best . By the way , when do you take over the new position ?"
"Next month ."
"So what are you responsible for ?"
"I'm going to manage the whole accounts department ."
"So you must get higher pay than before ."
"Yes , the company will also give me a prize of 1,000 Yuan ."
"1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... , OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat ."
"Really ? Can I order anything I want ?"
"Of course . Let's go . "
"Good afternoon , Miss Qi ."
"Good afternoon.It ' s very nice to see you again ."
"How are you feeling today ?"
"I'm much better.The stomachache is gone , and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed ."
"That's good.Well , these are for you . I hope you will like them ."
"How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much ."
"I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital ."
"You're so thoughtful !"
"It's time for me to leave . I hope you will recover soon.See you later ."
"Thank you for coming.Good - bye . "
"Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ?"
"Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something !"
"With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly ."
"That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money ."
"Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? "
"Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ?"
"Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal ."
"Certainly , what day were you thinking of ?"
"How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ?"
"Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ?"
"Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ?"
"Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ?"
"Sure , Merton Financial Advisors ."
"Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that . "
"Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ?"
"Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole ."
"I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos ."
"Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ?"
"Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili ."
"Sounds good ."
"Would you like anything to drink ?"
"Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . "
"Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you ."
"I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ?"
"I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in ."
"All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? "
"Why are you up so early , Mary ?"
"I'm still suffering from a little jetlag ."
"What are you watching ?"
"Saturday morning cartoons ."
"At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays ."
"I think watching them is a great way to learn English ."
"I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults ."
"Yeah . Is Cindy up ?"
"Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . "
"Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ?"
"There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding ."
"Trust me . I've been driving for two years ."
"Ok . You drive and do be careful . "
"Do you have any special interests besides your job ?"
"My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends ."
"What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?"
"I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better ."
"There is a reason in what you say . "
"I have a little problem with room 507 ."
"Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem ."
"This room is filthy with cockroaches ."
"Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ?"
"I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough !"
"Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots ."
"You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement !"
"I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? "
"I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment ."
"Are you having problems ? This is the first I ’ Ve heard of it ."
"We gave you a list of problems last week ."
"What kind of problems are you talking about ?"
"Well , the garbage disposal doesn ’ t work , we have rats , and the toilet is backed up ."
"Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks . I am leaving on vacation this afternoon ."
"These things are your responsibility , and you need to fix them immediately ."
"Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it !"
"If these problems are not addressed immediately , I will be contacting the health department this Friday and you will not get a rent check ."
"I ’ ll be right over ! "
"We're now staying at the Holiday Inn . How do we get to the airport ?"
"We have shuttle buses leaving for the airport from downtown every 20 minutes The bus stops at Holiday Inn as well . Be sure to get on the bus before 30 ."
"What is the earliest one ?"
"At 7 am . It takes about one hour to get to the airport . So it'll be right for your timing ."
"OK , thank you . By the way , what can I do if I want to put off my flight ?"
"Your tickets are valid for one year.If you want to change flight , you just go to the airline's ticketing office and have it reconfirmed . But you have to fly the same airlines ."
"OK . What can I do if l want to cancel the ticket ?"
"In that case . you can get a refund with a certain percentage of the original fare deducted as the service charge ."
"That's reasonable . OK , thank you very much . "
"OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment ."
"What's going on over there ?"
"They're setting up the machine for a new run ."
"How long does that usually take ?"
"About twenty minutes ."
"What's happening at the far end ?"
"That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . "
"I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room ."
"It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood ."
"What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen ."
"It's a bit small but looks nice.What ' s more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . "
"I would like to buy a ticket to New York please ."
"When do you plan to travel ?"
"I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight ."
"Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ?"
"Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what ."
"I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ?"
"I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket ."
"When would you like to return ?"
"My return date will be the 14th ."
"OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?"
"Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy !"
"OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 , Will there be any layovers ?"
"No , all flights are direct ."
"Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ?"
"$ 800 dollars . "
"The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance ."
"What kind of performance ? A lion dance ?"
"Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous ."
"Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before ."
"Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ?"
"Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people ."
"I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals ."
"What about the costumes ?"
"We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe ."
"Try something new . We can find a supporting agency ."
"Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . "
"Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ?"
"You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods ."
"Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are ."
"Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains ."
"What things should I avoid ?"
"You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar ."
"Beyond diet , what else can I do to be healthy ?"

Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ?"
"Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars !"
"Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ?"
"It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt ."
"I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans ."
"That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right !"
"Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C ."
"back to you , Tom . "
"Would you please take a seat over there ? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table ."
"Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ?"

"Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ?"
"No . These terms need to be amplified ."
"What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ?"
"Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms ."
"Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade ."
"Yes , that's very important . "

"Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial ."
"I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms ."
"But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight ."
"We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 ."

"Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers ."
"If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full ."

"No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees ! "

"I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy ."
"I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ?"
"It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ?"

"Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ?"
"Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ?"
"Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us ."
"How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ?"
"Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each ."

"I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ?"

"A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up ."
"Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable ."
"Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic ."
"I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing ."
"Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon ."
"Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . "

"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord ."
"Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage ."
"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable ."
"It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable ! "
"Welcome . How can I help you ?"

"I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required , It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client ."
"Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client ."
"I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ?"
"Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour ."
"You certainly had a busy day ."
"That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . "
"May I help you ?"
"My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is ."
"What dose she look like ?"
"She has blond hair and blue eyes ."
"What was she wearing ?"
"She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers ."
"When did you last see her ?"
"I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is ."
"How long has it been ?"
"Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . "
"This is my first trip to Hong Kong , and I'd like to see some of the city's sights ."
"Will you be here long ?"
"Only three days on business so I won't have a long time ."
"There are many tourist attractions in Hong Kong ."
"Do you have some information on these ?"
"Let me give you some brochures to look over . "
"I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City ."
"Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ?"
"Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here ."
"I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York ."
"Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live ."
"Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . "
"Is this the right bus for San Francisco ?"
"It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine ."
"When's the first stop ?"
"About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me ."
"Thank you ."
"Is it all right to smoke on the bus ?"
"Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed ."
"I see . Thank you . "
"What is the best way to find a job here ?"
"There are different ways of conducting a job search . Do you know what you want to do ?"
"I don't know ."
"Can you work part-time or full-time ?"
"It doesn't matter right now , either one would be OK ."
"The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . Understand ?"
"OK , I'll go check it out ."
"Schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information . Would that work for you ?"
"I am not sure ."
"Everything that you need for a successful job search is here . Happy job searching ! "
"Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ?"
"No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ?"
"You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?"
"No , Officer , not at all ."
"Then how can you explain your behavior ?"
"Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer ."
"Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?"
"Um , because I was busy talking to my friend ."
"On a cell phone ?"
"Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions ."
"That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . "
"To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ?"
"First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business ."
"Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ?"
"I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions ."
"Do you have any questions about the job ?"
"Yes . Are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ?"
"Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas ."
"That would be good . "
"Ouch ! I just bit my tongue ."
"Oh , that hurts ."
"I think it's bleeding . "
"Hello , miss . I would like to check out ."
"Well , sir . If you want to check out now , we will charge you $ 200 as well ."
"Why ? I have stayed for 3 nights ."
"Well , the check out time is 12:00 o'clock everyday , if you checked out after 15:00 , we have to charge you for another day . "
"Alison , would you like to have some more ?"
"No , thanks . I've had enough ."
"Actually you haven't had much ."
"To tell you the truth , I am on a diet ."
"That sounds ridiculous . Why ?"
"Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
"Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ?"
"She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs ."
"What made you think that she wasn't very confident ?"
"Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ?"
"She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ?"
"When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional ."
"you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ?"
"It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture !"
"I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language ."
"On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting ."
"That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then ."
"Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! "
"I have a feeling you will get this job ."
"Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out ."
"Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile ."
"I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations ."
"Have you updated your resume recently ?"
"Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address ."
"You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot ."
"I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview ."
"Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ?"
"Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic ."
"I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference ."
"Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! "
"Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine ."
"Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you ."
"How long was she employed with your company ?"
"She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with ."
"Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ?"
"She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . "
"Hi , is that Jason ?"
"Yes . What can I do for you ?"
"I am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch ."
"That's cool . What documents do I need to carry ?"
"You can bring life photos , recommendation letters and certificates . "
"I'd like to check out ."
"Have you settled the bill ?"
"No . I'd like to do that now ."
"OK , 400 Yuan please . "
"I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong , please ."
"For what days , madam ?"
"Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th ."
"Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ?"
"I prefer to sit next to a window ."
"How would like to pay ?"
"I have a Master Card ."
"I have booked you for one window seat on American airline flight No . 409 . Have a good trip ! "
"Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image ."
"Surely it is ."
"You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him ."
"You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words ."
"When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer ."
"Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous ."
"Proper posture can show your confidence ."
"The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer ."
"Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well ."
"Throughout the interview you should maintain patience ."
"In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview ."
"Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . "
"Good morning . Sales Division . Alex speaking ."
"Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you ."
"Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ?"
"Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! "
"Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ?"
"I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting ."
"Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ?"
"It is ok . My boss briefs me later on ."
"Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ?"
"Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . "
"Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ?"
"We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours ."
"That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ?"
"No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . "
"Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !"
"I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !"
"Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... , What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! "
"Where do you live ?"
"I live in Beijing ."
"What's your permanent address ?"
"My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing ."
"Where is your birthplace ?"
"My birthplace is Suzhou ."
"Where is your domicile ?"
"My domicile is Beijing ."
"Give me your telephone number , please ."

"This is my favourite restaurant ."
"It looks very nice and the food looks delicious ."
"Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before ."
"Really ?"
"Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ?"
"No , I haven ’ t . I have never eaten jellyfish before ."
"What about these ? Have you ever tried pig ’ s brains ?"
"No , I have not and I ’ m not sure I want to try them now . "
"Well Mr . Black , I appreciate your interest in our company , but I doubt you can do this job properly ."
"I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance ."
"I wish I could . But you even don ’ t have a B . A , so I ’ m sorry to say there ’ s no chance ."
"You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss ."
"Mr . Black , I don ’ t think my boss will talk to you . It ’ s a Chinaman ’ s chance ."
"You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! "
"Can I go to my room , now ?"
"Yes , just follow the porter , Mr.Wilson ."
"Thank you , sir . "
"How about the repair fee ?"
"It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years ."
"Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ?"
"They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment ."
"I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ?"
"That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation ."
"To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time ."
"Thank you again ! "
"Can you drive ?"
"Yes , I have a driving license ."
"Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ?"
"Sure ."
"One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently ."
"That's fine with me ."
"Would you mind relocating ?"
"As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind ."
"It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ?"
"I think I can commute that far without any trouble ."
"Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ?"
"No , nothing in particular . Thank you ."
"Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends ."
"Yes , but I don't mind working hard . "
"Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ?"
"OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite ."
"Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you . "
"I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ?"
"I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods ."
"In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling ."
"What are they ?"
"First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ?"
"That can be easily done . Is there anything else ?"
"The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel ."
"We'll get the factory to meet your requirements ."
"Thanks for your help . "
"I am interested in buying a house and need some information ."
"Yes , of course . What area are you interested in ?"

"Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ?"
"I would love to have a home with a view ."
"Fine , I will begin a search for the perfect home for you . I will call you in a few days . "
"What should I do when I find a job ?"
"There are a few considerations . Is this a part-time or full-time job ?"
"Does it make a difference ?"
"Basically , you really don ’ t need to do much of anything . On the Continued Claim Form , you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning ."
"If I get work for a few weeks , will I be terminated from EDD ?"
"You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work . You can always come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance . "
"I think mum should not take sides . After all , we are all her children ."
"But our younger sister is the apple of her eye ."
"It ’ s unfair ."
"Well , we can do nothing about it . "
"I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson ."
"Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ?"
"This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ?"

"Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus ."
"That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . "
"How is your job search 1 going , Janet ?"
"I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company ."
"Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !"
"Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job ."
"I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work ."
"I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted ."
"Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . "
"Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ?"
"What kind of benefits are we talking about ?"
"Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car ."
"Are these things negotiable ?"
"Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ?"
"Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days ."
"What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ?"
"Possibly . What do you have in mind ? "
"Hi Jane , you look great ."
"You too . Have you lost some weight ?"
"Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it ."

"Good for you , keep it up . "
"What a beautiful day !"
"The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning ."
"I was worried about canceling the climbing ."
"Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further ."
"What about taking the cable car ?"
"Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking ."
"Wow , What a long queue this is !"
"Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken ."
"Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky ."
"Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ?"
"So you wanna stay here ?"
"Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . "
"Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager ."
"Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ?"
"I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese ."
"Why would you like to work with us ?"
"It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it ."

"You have a very good taste , this pair is the latest product ."
"What function does this watch have ?"
"Both of them are luminous with a time reminder function . They don't need battery , because they can absorb energy from the sun ."
"Sounds good ."
"In addition , they are waterproof and shockproof ."
"How long is the guarantee ?"
"We guarantee the quality of the product for 12 months . We also provide a worldwide warranty ."
"How much does the pair cost ?"
"2,200 $ ."
"It is a bit expensive . But it is worth buying one's favorite . I will take them . "

"I jumped the gun ."
"There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow ."
"Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . "
"Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ?"
"Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first ."
"I am all ears ."
"First , can I know something about your financial situations ?"
"Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents ."
"Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ?"

"The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service ."
"What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ?"
"That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill ."
"I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies !"
"Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . "
"Hello , Vicki ."
"Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it ."
"Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend ."
"I think seven hundred is enough ."
"What ? Seven hundred ?"
"Well , eight hundred , then ?"
"No , one thousand at least ."
"Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed !"
"You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right ."
"Here you are , sucker !"
"Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! "
"There's so much to do and so little time ."
"I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ?"
"Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium !"
"OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ?"
"All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted ."
"Great . She'll be so happy . "
"Hi ! How are things going with you ?"
"I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ?"
"Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job ."
"The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ?"
"I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head ."
"How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ?"
"I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed ."
"How about the electrician program that they have listed over there ?"
"I read about that , and the position sounded great !"
"Let ’ s go see how we can apply for those positions . "

"I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today ."
"Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon ."
"I'm afraid we have to reschedule it ."
"Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ?"
"I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away ."
"How about Friday afternoon ?"
"That will be fine . "
"Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ?"
"Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching ."
"That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule ."

"According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day ."
"How about the lunch break , Lucy ?"
"From 11:30 to 1 o ’ clock ."
"May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?"
"Sometimes , but not quite often . "
"Could you give some information on your European tours ?"
"Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe ."
"I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time ."
"I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th ."
"What is the cost ?"
"The price for one person for a ten-day tour is only 1,099 US dollars , which includes round trip airfare ."
"That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation ."
"Ok , but don't delay too long , or that trip will be all booked . "
"I'd like to see a tea set , please ?"
"How about the Japanese ones ?"
"They're OK , but I prefer chinese ones ."
"Oh , I see . I'll show you some . "
"So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ?"
"I ’ Ve got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with ."
"What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours ."
"No , I did that a long time ago . It ’ s about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus ."
"He still doesn ’ t know that Santa isn ’ t real ? How old is he , eight ?"
"Yes . He ’ s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ’ s getting older ... , You think it ’ s better that he should be told ?"
"Yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . And I ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do ."
"That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real ."
"I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son ."
"Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that . "
"I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account ."
"Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account ."
"Okay , here are the forms . Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ?"
"Certainly . Just make them out to National Bank , and sign and date them ."
"Okay , here you are . "
"It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland ."
"Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match ."
"The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !"
"Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play ."

"Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o , Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ?"
"Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo , Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it !"
"Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care ."
"Thanks doc , bye ! "
"Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ?"
"Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings ."
"Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future ."
"You can bet on that . "
"In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off ."
"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord ."
"Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage ."
"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . "" , It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' "

"After a while . "

"Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ?"
"You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job ."
"OK . Let me see where to start ."
"I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ?"
"Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume ."
"Then what else should I put into my resume ?"
"Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ?"
"I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ?"
"Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward ."
"I see . Is that all there is to it ?"
"No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take ."
"Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss ."
"You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume ."
"That's easy ."
"And one more thing , smile widely . "
"There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day !"
"I think something must be done ."
"Yeah , we should have more roads built . "
"This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here ."
"You look a little lost , can I help you ?"

The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson .

"Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ?"
"I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this ."
"What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !"
"Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick ."
"Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain ."
"I am wiped out . Thank you ."

"Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise ."
"By the way , do you work out ?"
"No , but I am starting working out from now on ."
"Fine . "
"Why have you stopped production ?"
"We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off ."
"OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ?"
"I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed ."
"Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China ."
"May I have your name , please ?"
"Feynman Black . I want to leave on October 15th ."

"OK . Thank you . "
"I would like to take my vacation next month ."
"How long did you have in mind ?"

"Oh , so am I ."
"Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ?"

"To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . "
"Ms . Wang , this is Mr . Cooper , president of Ivy Publishing ."

"What can I do for you ?"
"I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash ."
"OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned ."
"That's OK . But that must be costly ."
"Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' ."
"Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer ."
"Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually ."
"I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash ."
"Never mind . You can leave them to me ."
"Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing ."
"It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know ."
"I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ?"
"That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . "
"What are you guys doing over there ?"
"What do you mean , Janice ?"
"I ’ Ve been waiting for a response on the Blake Building design for nearly two weeks ."

"How can I help you ?"
"Yes , I would like to look at some of your products ."
"Did you have anything specific in mind ?"

"We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ?"
"The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street ."
"Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?"
"That's why I think it may suit my needs ."
"I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed ."
"The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?"
"Yes . But not including the utilities ."
"Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ?"
"I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know ."
"Oh , that's no problem . "
"Hello.This is room 1205.Our message lamp is flaming ."

"Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !"
"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest ."
"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions ."
"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him ."
"Me too ."
"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out ."
"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?"
"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited ."
"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him ."
"And the host announced that he won it all ! "
"Can you change American dollars into French francs ."
"Yes . How much do you want ?"

"One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ?"

"Hello , Mr . Smith , I am returning to Shanghai by the 10:00 plane . I am calling to thank you for all your help during my stay here ."
"Don't mention it . It's been my pleasure ."
"Next time you are in Shanghai , please let me know , and let me be of some assistance to you ."
"OK . I will ."
"Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call . "
"Good morning . Ru Via Hotel , Room Reservation . Can I help you ?"

"How and in whose name has the reservation been made ?"
"By telephone and in my name ."
"Please wait a moment . I'll check it in the computer . Thanks for your waiting . You've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for March 5th , 6th and 7th , is it correct ?"
"Right , but the negotiation has been postponed until 5th to 7th of April . Do you think it's possible for us to change the reservation ?"
"Let me check the reservation list . Fortunately , we have just 10 standard rooms available for the three days . "
"When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?"
"I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?"
"I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill ."
"That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant ."
"That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?"
"Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill ."
"Did you ? How is he these days ?"
"He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other ."
"I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ?"
"Of course . What do you want to move first ?"
"Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . "
"Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important ."
"Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience ."
"Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality , Professional suits may be the best choice ."
"Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome ."
"Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up ."
"But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided ."
"Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine ."
"You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview ."
"Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed ."
"In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all ."
"In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . "
"I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month ."
"It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax ."

"If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first ."
"How ?"
"You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up ."
"Very useful advice , I will try them right now . "
"What are your career goals , Miss Li ?"
"Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours ."
"Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours ."
"What would a typical day be like for me here ?"
"Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work ."
"Oh , yes , I do . My present job is similar in that respect , and I think I ’ m doing a good job . "
"Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website ."
"If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast ."
"We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it ."
"We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products ."
"Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ?"
"I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out ."
"I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . "
"We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things ."
"Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office ."
"Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ?"
"We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit ."
"Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . "
"Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ?"
"Well , if you can meet our deadline ."
"That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet ."
"I also hope your quality will meet our standard ."
"We never fail to meet our client's expectation ."
"Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . "
"Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?"
"How regular ?"
"An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that ."
"You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights ."
"But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days ."
"That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . "
"Did you have any publications ?"
"Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine ."
"Have you received any honors ?"
"Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college . "
"Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ?"
"15 dollars per dozen , Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price ."
"However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words ."
"If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot ."
"This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years ."
"I hope you'll give a second thought to it ."
"We'll have to discuss the problem later ."
"What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ?"
"Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ?"
"About 300 dozens ."
"Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays ."
"OK . That's a deal . "
"Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees ."
"Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today ."
"I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back ."
"You mean , if there is any left over ?"
"Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system ."
"Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ?"
"That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . "
"What do you like for dessert ?"
"Do you have trifles ?"
"Yes ."
"Please bring me some trifles and apple pies ."
"OK . I will bring it for you . "
"A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?"
"Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave ."
"Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that ."
"Certainly , work always comes first ."
"But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days ."
"Well , keep a low profile . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I would like to have a roll developed ."
"When do you need them , sir ?"
"How about tomorrow morning ?"
"No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ?"
"The 4 x6 will be OK . Thanks ."
"And do you want the glossy or matted finish ?"
"I prefer glossy . How much ?"
"You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film ."
"Thanks ! "
"Hello . I have a room booked for tonight , the 15th ."
"Alright and what is your name , please ?"
"It ’ s Marcia Gleason ."
"Ah , yes , here you are Ms . Gleason . You reserved a single , right ?"
"Yes , a single , thanks ."
"Do you mind being next to the elevator ?"
"Actually , I ’ d prefer not to be . "
"I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday ."
"Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer ."
"You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?"
"To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression ."
"But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . "
"Hello . I am calling to apply for the job as an airlines staff . I'd like to check it . Is it part-time or a full-time job ?"
"OK , the job is a full-time one ."
"What does the job description say ?"
"We need a person with ability and flexibility . "
"Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ?"
"China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation , We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable , Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent , Can I have a reduction of seven percent ?"
"It depends on how much you order , Can I use the FAS terms ?"
"I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . "
"We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ?"
"It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount ."
"That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ?"
"But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % ."
"Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ?"
"Maybe we would consider a longer credit period ."
"That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . "
"I heard that EDD has special services to help me get a job ."
"callous is a great Internet-based placement service that is available to you ."
"I don ’ t have access to a computer ."
"There is an area at the EDD Center that is set up with computers for you to make use of ."
"Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ?"
"We can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . We also provide workshops ."
"If I go to EDD in person , what type of workshops might I find there ?"
"Our two most important workshops are Resume Writing and Interviewing ."
"What are some other places where I might look for work ?"
"Job fairs are popular places to look for work . "
"We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank ."
"It is so terrible to be caught unaware ."
"Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned ."
"Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply ."
"Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief ."
"State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details ."
"Never should you give an answer completely beside the point ."
"If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly ."
"Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule ."
"Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly ."
"Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can ."
"It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . "
"Hello !"
"Hello ! Could I speak to Sheerly Lim please ?"
"Sure , just a second.Who ' s calling ?"
"This is Sue from work ."
"Ok , sue , I will just go in get her . "

"Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ?"
"OK , thanks a lot . See you then . "
"China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ?"
"It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run ."
"We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ?"
"Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . "
"Good morning.May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'm looking for an apartment . I'd like two bedrooms ."

"There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?"
"I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper ."
"What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?"
"I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market ."
"I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . "
"What can I do for you , sir ?"

"Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?"
"Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business , Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood ."
"Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down ."
"I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?"
"Sure . "
"Anything else ?"
"Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?"
"Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . If you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year ."
"How about sick days ?"

"That's fine . "
"Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours . How can I help you ?"
"I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife ."
"Very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend ."
"I think something in the countryside would be nice ."
"Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick-up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirty-minute ride to the countryside ."

You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush , green gardens .

"Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard ."
"I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object ! "
"Now let's use the weight machines ."
"How about the rowing machine , Great . They've all got built-in TVs ."
"Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal !"
"But we could just stay there for 20 minutes ."
"What exercises can I do to firm up my backside , I would recommend doing some squats . Spread your feet about shoulder-length apart , toes facing forward , and slowly bend at your knees ."
"Like this ?"
"Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 . "
"What's wrong with you ?"
"I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow ."
"Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again ."
"I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book ."
"It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document ."
"I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment ."
"It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment ."
"Can I mail the book if it is a large file ?"
"There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB ."
"What if it exceeds the capacity ?"
"You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning . "
"What was your duty like in your previous job ?"
"We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists ."
"Can you name a few examples ?"
"Yes . There are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people , common routine for people who are on trade observation tour , and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing . "
"When should I make my presence known ?"
"Wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly . "
"Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?"
"What do you need ?"
"I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him ."
"He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . "
"Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids ."
"Good for you . Did you use Paypal ?"
"Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out ."
"That's the beauty of it , and the danger ."
"I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera ."
"How much ?"
"Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months ."
"Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . "
"Here's your roast chicken , ma'am ."
"Thank you ."
"Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ?"
"Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce ) Here you are . Can get you anything else ?"
"I'm fine for now , thanks . "
"We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break ."
"Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . "
"Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ?"
"Do you want to buy a new bicycle ?"
"Yes , and they have a sale on now ."
"What happened to your old one ?"
"I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back ."
"Let's go then ."
"Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ?"
"I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive ."
"How much is it ?"
"The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount ."
"OK , let's go and ask . "
"Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan ."
"I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network ."
"What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone ."
"Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free ."
"Really ? What ’ s the catch ?"
"There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan ."
"So what does this plan include ?"
"Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option ."
"Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?"
"That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... "
"My TV hasn't got a clear picture recently.How ' s yours ?"
"It's OK . I can always get a clear picture on it ."
"I think something is wrong with mine ."
"You'd better have it fixed . "
"Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ?"
"Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match ."
"OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific ."
"Of course . It's a newly-built one ."
"We are lucky to play in a new stadium ."
"Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting ."
"Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line ."
"Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ?"
"Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well ."
"Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint ."
"No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully ."
"Really ? You must be ... , But that game he dunked over me for 13 times ."
"That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half ."
"Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down ."
"He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . "
"What's for dinner ?"
"Leftovers ."
"What ? Leftovers of what and from when ?"
"From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches !"
"Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?"
"Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius ."
"Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning ."
"Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! "
"Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods ."
"Sure . What's your date of delivery ?"
"I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month ."
"What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ?"
"We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days ."
"Can you deliver them earlier ?"
"I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ?"
"Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees ."
"Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months ."
"I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation ."
"I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit ."
"Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . "
"Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ?"
"I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please ."
"That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you ."
"You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home ."
"Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ?"
"Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big ."
"Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful ."
"That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks . "
"Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ?"
"Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well ."
"Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package ."
"How much is this going to cost ?"
"Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ?"
"What ’ s the difference ?"
"Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online ."
"I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . "
"Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you today ?"
"Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you ."
"I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ?"
"We have recently started doing a lot of business with British companies , so we'd like to open a GAP account . How should we go about this ?"
"The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal . I mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . We also need your Business Licence and the Enterprise Standard Code Certificate . Then we can go on to the next step ."
"That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible . "
"I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap ."
"I know and they are really nice , too ."
"I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors ."
"Me , too ."
"Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow ."
"Good idea , especially at this price . "
"Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ?"
"You ’ re right ."
"Look ! The iron is still on ."
"I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now ."
"Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it ."
"I ’ m sorry , Jim ."
"Never mind , dear . "
"Can you put me through to May Flower Restaurant , please ?"
"Just a second ... Sorry , the line is engaged ."
"OK , I ’ ll try later . Thanks anyway ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"What does your company do exactly ?"
"We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year ."
"And who do you sell to ?"
"We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . "
"Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience ."
"I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments ."
"What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ?"
"My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged ."
"Why did you leave your last position ?"
"I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow ."
"What are your strengths and weaknesses ?"
"One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime ."
"How would your boss describe you and your work style ?"
"She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity ."
"Do you have any questions ?"
"Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? "
"In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people ."
"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !"
"Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places ."
"Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people ."
"Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas ."
"What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar ."
"Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . "
"How about we taking a tour to Hawaii ? I have a 2 - weeks ' vacation ."
"That sounds fantabulous . I have dreamed of going there for months ."
"Me , too . Why don't we get ready now ?"
"Sure . I don't want to waste even a minute . "
"Good afternoon . How can I help ?"
"Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ?"
"Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ?"
"Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ?"
"Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad ."
"That sounds pretty good . OK , I'll change 500 USD today , thanks . "
"Hello ! Where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?"
"Maybe you should look around for an outlet ."
"That is a wonderful idea ."
"Outlets have more reasonable prices ."
"Thank you for your help ."
"No problem . Good luck . "
"This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs ."
"That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul ."
"The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands ."
"I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? "
"OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement ."
"Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see , is that our expenses are through the roof ."
"Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here !"
"Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges !"
"OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it ."
"The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments !"
"Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it ."
"Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? !"
"OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! "
"Sorry to have smoked in your room ."
"Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window ."
"It ’ s very kind of you ."
"Smoking is harmful for your health ."
"I know . I ’ ll try to give it up . "
"Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ?"

"Well . We ’ re expecting about twenty-five people and we ’ d like to spend no more than $ 20 a head . "
"Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married ."
"Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you ."
"When ’ s the big day ?"

"Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ?"
"This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ?"
"Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?"
"We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience ."
"Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ?"
"Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ?"
"Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go ."
"That ’ s a good idea . "
"Mum , pass me some more please !"
"Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don't eat these crisps any more ."
"But the ads say they're most nutritious ."
"Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? "
"Do you know our major business ?"
"Yes , I know it is one of the leading industries in the petrochemical field ."
"Do you have a long-term plan for your career ?"
"Yes , I hope I will be a manager in 5 years . "
"Hello , this is Julie from Google Corp . Is that Jin Lili ?"
"Yes , this is Jin Lili . What can I do for you , I am calling to impart the news that you are supposed to have an interview ."
"There is too much static on the line ."
"I said that you are supposed to have an interview ."
"Pardon ? I can hardly hear you . I will call you later . "
"I'd like to mail this letter to Taipei ."
"Where ?"
"Taiwan ."
"That'll be 64 cents ."
"Okay . Can I also have a sheet of 20 sixty-four-cent stamps ?"
"Sure . The total comes to twelve dollars and eighty cents ."
"By the way , how much does it cost to send a package to Taiwan ?"
"That depends on the weight ."
"I see . "
"Could you bring me some food , please ?"
"Sure . What do you fancy ?"
"Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ?"
"Sir , the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out . May I suggest the porterhouse ?"
"Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then ."
"Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?"
"Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion ."
"Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ?"
"No problem ."
"Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it . "
"I'm worrying that she may be lost ."
"Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area ."
"After all , she is a five-year-old kid ."
"Ok , I'll go out and look for her . "
"Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ?"
"Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired ."
"Which brand are you interested in ?"
"I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ?"
"Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ?"
"It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK ."
"How about Flymo ? It's selling well ."
"Do you have a warranty on it ?"
"Of course . The warranty period is one year ."
"If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?"
"Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you ."
"OK . I'll take one . "
"I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight !"
"If you tell me the exact problem , I can be more helpful ."
"Cockroaches have declared war on my room !"
"Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight ."
"Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence ."
"Sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do . "
"We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out ."
"What problems are you having exactly ?"
"The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent ."
"That is high ."
"Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards ."
"But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market ."
"The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control ."
"That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike ."
"I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent ."
"Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . "
"Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ?"
"Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza ."
"Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then ."
"Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ?"
"If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier ."
"I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then !"
"See you tonight . "
"What happened ?"
"That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move ."
"What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ?"
"The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot ."
"Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP ."
"I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while ."
"Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out ."
"Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? "
"How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job ?"
"Work is work , whether it ’ s a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig ."
"So I guess I have to report that I ’ Ve found a little bit of work ."
"All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest ."
"What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks ? Can I take it ?"
"It is to your advantage to work as much as you can . "
"I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account ."
"Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ?"
"Sure ?"
"Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ."
"That ’ s right . "

"How would you seat them ?"

"What does a housing go for in south mountain district ?"
"It depends on the type of the house you're looking for ."
"We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home ."
"What ’ s your general price range ?"
"Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose ."
"Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest ."
"What about a two-bedroom house ?"
"A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB ."
"I see ."
"I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family ."
"Okay , I will take it into consideration . "
"Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible !"
"I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days ."

"I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ?"
"Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left ."
"Great , I'll take one ."
"Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow ."
"Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ?"
"I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ?"
"Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ?"
"That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too . "

"No , I borrowed it ."
"Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive ."
"You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me ... , I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo as the car . "
"Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday ."
"Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ?"
"That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer ."
"That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ?"
"Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early ."

"I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork ."
"Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently ."
"That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ?"
"That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . "

"Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ?"
"I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ?"
"I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories ."
"Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists ."
"Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable ."
"Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food ."
"Seriously ?"
"Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so ."
"Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet ."
"Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine ."
"But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body . "
"Do you take in students ?"
"Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available ."
"How much is it ?"
"30.00 dollars a week ."
"Do you think I could have a look at it , please ."
"I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? "
"We can offer you a 5 % discount ."
"Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer ."
"Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ?"
"When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient ."
"What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction ."
"There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great ."
"How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large ."
"Ok . I can settle for that . "
"This is the Pan-American Club.May I help you ?"
"Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday.Could you give me some more information about that ?"

"Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache ."
"I strongly urge you to change your diet.You shouldn't eat too many desserts ."
"Nothing works with my toothache now ."
"You should go to the dentist ."
"I hate dentists ."
"Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist ."
"It always hurts . I hate going ."
"Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out ."
"OK , OK , I ’ ll go ."
"Good . You will feel better after you do . "
"I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised ."
"Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated ."
"That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office ."
"No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details ."
"I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost ."
"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there ."
"Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ?"
"Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place ."

"Hello , may I help you ?"
"I'd like to send a fax to Shanghai ."

"Document ."
"Show me your document , please ."
"Here you are ."
"Ah , it is clear enough to send ."
"How long will it take to get to Shanghai ."
"It'll only take a couple of minutes ."
"Oh , excellent . How much does it cost ?"
"Twenty yuan . "
"I like to drive on freeway ."
"Don't drive too fast ."
"Don't worry.There ' re few cars now ."
"Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast . "
"I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday , You are welcome , Mr . Sun ."
"I really enjoyed meeting with you ."
"You certainly made a good impression on me as well ."

"Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ?"
"Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California ."
"And this is your company's head office ?"
"Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone ."
"That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ?"
"That's right . We are their sole PR sector business ."
"That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ?"
"Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . "
"Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do ."
"Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ?"
"No . It isn't ."
"OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment ."
"But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ?"
"Have you tried pressing the Escape key ?"
"Yes , but nothing's happened ."
"OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time ."
"I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ?"
"You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? "
"Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ?"
"We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special ."
"I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine ."
"There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting ."
"But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday !"
"Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working ."
"Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ?"
"I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers !"
"That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean ."
"We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like ."
"We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave . Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow ."
"It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! "
"Hello . Is Becky there , please ?"
"Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free ."
"Thanks ."
"Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now ."

"Linen.It ' s ideal for summer wear ."

"I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ?"
"yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days ."
"good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest ."
"OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work ."
"have you been working hard recently ?"
"yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little ."
"good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other Sy , I have a bad headache , but ... , don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an , thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . "

"I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ."
"Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night ."
"That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night ."
"Okay , sir , bear with me a moment ."
"Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word ."
"One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file ."
"You can , I feel your pain , sir ."
"Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves ."
"I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . "
"To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later ."
"Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ?"
"A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered ."
"Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?"
"Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month ."
"Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home ."
"When will that be ?"
"Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit ."
"You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C ."
"That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation ."
"Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future ."
"By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ?"
"Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into ."
"If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner ."
"Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time ."
"All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect ."
"We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . "
"Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ?"
"Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade ."
"I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet ."
"Yes , I often do business through internet now ."
"Oh , really ? Is it a good way ?"
"Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house ."
"What advantages does it have ?"
"Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service ."
"I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition ."
"The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers ."
"So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time ."
"Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways ."
"Will you give me some suggestion ?"
"Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website ."
"Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . "
"That'll be 12 dollars and 95 cents , please ."
"Can you break a 100 dollar bill ?"
"Oh , you don't have anything smaller ?"
"No , I'm sorry . That's all I have . Unless you take a credit card ."
"Oh , sure . Credit card is fine . "
"Hi , Mary , I have decided to look for a job as a salesman ."
"Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?"
"Yes . I have found some through different channels ."
"Really ? That's great ! Tell me ."
"OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines ."
"What do you think of this job ?"
"I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well ."
"Then how about the others ?"
"Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments ."
"I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development ."
"I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try ."
"Come on ! I believe you will succeed ."
"Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet ."
"Good idea . I will think it over . "
"How about your study at college ?"
"I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors ."
"Why did you select your college ?"
"I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation ."
"What do you like doing in your spare time ?"
"My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . "
"Look ! Allen has the mic !"
"I thought he only liked to listen !"
"That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself !"
"( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean !"
"And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! "
"Sorry to bother you . But I ’ m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with ."
"Sure Paula , shoot !"
"Well , it is about Ms . Connors , the landlord of our rented house ."
"Yeah , What happened ?"
"The dishwasher broke down . I had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check ."
"And so ... , She is threatening to evict us for not paying the full rent ."
"Hold on , Paula . It does sound pretty serious . But I ’ m sure you can work this out ."
"Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ’ re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight ."
"Sure , I ’ d be glad to help you straighten things out . Why don ’ t I stop by at about seven thirty ?"
"Thanks a million , you are a lifesaver . "
"Hello , Steven . We're thinking of appointing an agent for our products . I want you to find one for us ."
"OK . What sort of agent , exactly ?"
"The agent we are looking for will help us in Britain with publicity , advertising and so on ."
"OK . I ’ ll make enquiries . "
"What course did you like best ?"
"Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work ."
"Do you feel that you have received a good general training ?"
"Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . "
"Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting ."
"No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway ."
"Oh , good ."
"How much will it cost ?"
"Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars ."
"Taxi ! ! !"
"I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ?"
"Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ?"
"Right ."
"Driver , 1600 Pennsylvania Ave ."
"please . "
"I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price ."
"I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment ."
"I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now ."
"Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer ."
"Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon ."
"Sure , no problem . "
"Could I have your name , please ?"
"Kevin Belknap ."
"How do you spell your last name ?"
"B-E-L-K-N-A-P ."
"Right . Thank you very much ! "
"How much will our order from your factory be ?"
"I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days ."
"I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ?"
"Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ?"
"Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units ."
"Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ?"
"Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit ."
"Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . "
"Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters ."
"Great . What about the surrounding area ?"
"Very quiet and safe . And it ’ s got a lot of trees and plants ."
"That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ?"
"Yep , it ’ s near a bus stop ."
"Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then . "
"Do you know anything about health food ?"
"It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food ."
"Can you give me some examples ?"
"Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy ."
"Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ?"
"Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system ."
"Anything else ?"
"Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . "
"I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position . One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job ? I know the company you worked for is a good company ."
"yes , it's a good company . But the management changed last month . We didn ’ t get along , so I quit ."
"I understand . Why would you like to join our company ?"
"I'm qualified for this position . And I've heard a lot of good things about your company ."
"Like what ?"
"You take care of your employees . And your company offers good salaries and benefits ."
"that's good to know . Why do you think you ’ re qualified for this position ?"
"I've got over seven years ' experience working in this kind of position . I know I can do a good job in this position . "
"Do you play cards ?"
"Of course and very well ."
"What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ?"
"Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . "
"So can you fix it ?"
"I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do ."
"What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !"
"Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !"
"OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?"
"Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers ."
"I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !"
"This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
"Gongshan Development Co ."
"Ltd.may I help you ?"
"I'd like to speak your export manager , please ."
"May I ask who's calling , please ?"
"This is Mrs Wang , from Jane coper ."
"I'm sorry Mrs wang , but Mrs Fu is not in at the moment ."
"When will he come back , do you know ?"
"As suppose you reback at 10 , May I leave message ?"
"Of course ."
"Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number ."
"Ok , Mrs wang . I'll do that ."
"thank you . goodbye . "
"Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ?"
"Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent ."
"Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?"
"No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before ."
"It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?"
"A company account . I need to pay a bill ."
"Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number ."
"I have all the information in this folder ."
"Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today ."
"Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much ."
"It ’ s my pleasure . "
"Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there ."
"Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ?"
"Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ?"
"Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons ."
"No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday ."
"Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway ."
"Do you have a club card or will it be cash ?"
"Yeah I got a club card . Here you go ."
"Will this be debit or credit ?"
"Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great ."
"Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . "
"I ’ d like to buy these shoes ."
"O . K . Let me see . That will be $ 104.99 ."
"The price tag says $ 99.99 ."
"Yes , miss , but there is a five percent sales tax in Maryland ."
"Oh , of course . How silly of me to forget ."
"No problem . How would you like to pay for these ?"
"I think I have the cash . Let me check . Yes , here you are ."
"$ 110.00 , your change is $ 5.01 . Thanks very much ."
"Thank you . "
"Mom , can I have more allowance ?"
"What for ?"
"I want to buy more books ."
"Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ?"
"Of course not ! I'm telling the truth ."
"Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . "
"Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ?"
"Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract ."
"That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ?"
"Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate ."
"That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . "
"Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... , For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g , Certainly . And after your internship ?"
"They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really , Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right ."
"Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London ."
"The London Weekly right ."
"Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . "
"Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?"
"Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins ."
"Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?"
"Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up ."
"Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers ."
"You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !"
"You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ?"
"You ’ re so picky sometimes ."
"Here you go , honey , fried eggs ."
"I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . "
"Let me see your passport , please ."
"Oh , here you are ."
"You come from Germany , don't you ?"
"Yes . And come here for tourism ."
"How long will you be staying in China ?"
"Twenty days ."
"OK . Have you filled in the Declaration Form ?"
"Yes , here is the form ."
"Is this your luggage ?"
"Yes , only one travel bag ."
"What do you have in the luggage ?"
"Nothing but several personal effects ."
"That's all . Thank you for your co-operation . "
"Take me to this address , please ."
"Yes , Ma'am . Here we are ."
"How much do I owe you , sir ?"
"30 dollars , Ma'am ."
"Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ?"
"Yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip too ."
"I don't get it . I'll go and have our doorman talk to you then ."
"Ok , Ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . "
"Dental clinic . This is Mr . Adams ."
"Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment ."
"All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ?"
"A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts ."
"What tooth is giving you pain ?"
"One of the back ones ."
"Let me see ... We can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty . "
"Shall we go out tonight ?"
"Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco ."
"We'd better ask dad first ."
"Okay , but you ask him . "
"I am a reporter from Channel 5 News ."
"What ’ s up ?"
"Could I ask you some questions ?"
"Sure , you can ."
"Did you vote today ?"
"I sure did !"
"What candidate did you vote for ?"
"I can ’ t disclose that information ."
"Why is that ?"
"My vote is my own private business ."
"I understand ."
"I voted for our next President . "
"You look a bit under the weather ."
"I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around ."
"I know that it ’ s going around the dorms ."
"My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me ."
"I have some cold tablets if you would like one ."
"Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup ."
"Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold ."
"My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold ."
"You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions ."
"If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . "
"I need to see if I qualify for a home loan ."
"I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?"
"I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year ."
"How long have you been on your current job ?"
"I have only worked at this job for 6 months , but I have a longer job history elsewhere ."
"Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ?"
"No , I only receive my salary ."
"Do you know your credit score ?"
"I think that it is around 600 ."
"By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars . "
"Sorry sir . But you can ’ t go into the OR ."
"All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please ."
"It was touching girl for a while ."
"And now ?"
"She will be OK . She is a tough cookie ."
"That ’ s great news ."
"In my opinion she will up about soon ."
"That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor ."
"I believe it . Well , I ’ Ve got to go back in ."
"Thanks for helping her , doctor ."
"All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee ."
"Thanks . I will . "
"Did you work in a charity organization ?"
"Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on ."
"In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ?"
"I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . "
"I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough ."
"You say how high can be exciting ?"
"The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high ."
"I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings ."
"It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently ."
"Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . "
"Bill , please ."
"Please wait a moment ... here is the bill . Please check it ."
"Excuse me , what's this item for ?"
"For three bottles of Tsingtao beer ."
"But we've can canceled one bottle ."
"Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . ) , I'm sorry for the miscalculation . Here's the new bill . Would you mind checking it again ?"
"That's all right ."
"If you're staying at our hotel , you may sign the bill . "
"We're supposed to check in at the air-china ’ s counter . Thirty minutes before take off , Joe ."
"Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17 , Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in ."
"Yes , It ’ s essential ."
"What about our luggage ?"
"We can check it and hand carry small bags . And we have open each for inspection , Are they going to frisk all the passengers ?"
"I think so . we certainly don ’ t want a highjack to happen on our plane today . "
"You look kind of green ."
"I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach ."
"Have you had anything to eat lately ?"
"I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch ."
"Perhaps the food was bad ."
"Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now ."
"Has anything been upsetting you lately ?"
"My stress level is pretty much what is usually is ."
"Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?"
"It seems to me like I may have caught a bug . "
"Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down ."
"Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much ."
"I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind ."
"As you please . I ’ m ready ."
"The first is why you choose our company ?"
"I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement ."
"Why do you want to quit your present company ?"
"Well , the company has some financial problems . People there are all thinking of quitting ."
"Well , when do you think you can come over to work ?"
"One week after I have submitted my resignation paper ."
"When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month ."
"Thank you , sir . "
"Excuse me , what's the checking time for flight FA1187 ?"
"Have you paid the airport fee ?"
"Yes , and I have already gone through the safety inspection ."
"In that case , please get your passport and boarding card ready . Just wait in the terminal for twenty more minutes.You will hear the announcement ."
"Thank you . "
"Excuse me . Where is the Beijing railway station ?"
"You can take the subway to get there , How long will I take it to get there ?"
"It ’ s takes only about 10 minutes , May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ?"
"You can take No . 1 bus or taxi , Excuse me . Sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ?"
"Pleas turn right at the traffic lights ."
"Thank you very much "
"The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !"
"Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up ."
"That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !"
"Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded ."
"I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . "
"How long have you been in this company ?"
"I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job ."
"You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college ."
"Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee ."
"Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ?"
"It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . "
"How will you ship the order ?"
"Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think ."
"But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . "
"Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ?"
"I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ?"
"That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs ."
"And how much is payable in each instalment ?"
"You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due ."
"Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . "
"Mr . Phillips ? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval ."
"Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ?"
"I believe it ’ s going to Ms . Wilson ’ s office ."
"Get her on the phone , please . I need to clarify this . "
"Excuse me , what material is it ?"
"Rhaki.Do you want some ?"
"No , where are the cotton cloths ?"
"I will show you ."
"What is the shrink rate after washing ?"
"Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . "
"Excuse me ."
"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?"
"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare ."
"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order ."
"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?"
"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes ."
"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . "
"Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ?"
"He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me ."
"I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him ."
"I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way ."
"Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat ."
"It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy ."
"Whatever we said , we must be more careful ."
"Yes , I agree with you . "
"I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon ."
"Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges ."
"I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense ."
"All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation ."
"Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers ."
"We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price ."
"Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products ."
"The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount ."
"As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements ."
"Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement ."
"1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? ."
"I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further ."
"It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail ."
"All right . See you tomorrow . "
"Can I order something from the kitchen ?"
"Just tell me what you'd like , please ."
"A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot ."
"I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ?"
"Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger !"
"Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ?"
"Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries ."
"That'll be a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and porterhouse , all charged to your amenities account ."
"Not a problem ."
"Please call if you have any other requests . Your food will be delivered promptly . "
"These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ?"
"I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve !"
"What is our time frame ?"
"Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . "
"May I take yor order now ?"
"Yes , what do you have for appetizer ?"
"We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... , Well , please bring me the cold beef ."
"OK , sir . Do you want some soups ? "
"Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ?"
"Because they are rednecks . "
"Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave ."
"Really ? You've done a good job ."
"Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ?"
"I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ?"
"No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ?"
"Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows ?"
"Absolutely . Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ?"
"Yeah , let me have a try . "
"Hello ."
"Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad ."
"Hi , Dad . Where are you ?"
"I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me ."
"Thank you , Dad ."
"I love you ."
"I love you , too , Dad . "
"She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog ."
"Cats chase mice , don't they ?"
"And bugs . They can catch anything ."
"Do you have to walk a cat ?"
"No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart ."
"But then you have to change the litter box ."
"It's better than picking up dog poop . "
"The washing machine isn't working again ."
"It's not my fault . "
"Now we arrive at the Cambridge University , it is one of the oldest universities in the world ."
"I wish I had studied here . It's more than a university ."
"In 2009 Cambridge will come to its eight hundredth anniversary ."
"Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university . "
"What do you think of our price ?"
"Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?"
"Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly ."
"I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable ."
"I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level ."
"I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % ."
"I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price ."
"Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ?"
"We've already cut down our price to cost level ."
"Is that all ?"
"Yes this is the best we can do ."
"I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . "
"A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year ."
"It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ?"
"Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights ."
"Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents ."
"I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . "
"What are the requirements to apply for the position ?"
"Your major must be computer ."
"Do you think my educational background suits this position ?"
"Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications ."
"Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?"
"Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course ."
"Could you tell something about the job ?"
"Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints ."
"Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . "
"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?"
"thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store ."
"that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?"
"yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off ."
"true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time ."
"yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th , yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w , that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to ."
"I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . "
"When will the campus recruitment of L'Oreal being this year ?"
"According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th ."

"Yes , it is much earlier than past years . "
"Dahua's Market . How can I help you ?"
"Where is your store located ?"
"We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre ."
"Right , I'll be right over . "
"What do you think a job is ?"
"Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person ."
"Where do you see yourself three years from now ?"
"I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing ."
"That sounds reasonable ."
"It's the most important thing to me ."
"Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?"
"I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss ."
"You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye ."
"Goodbye . "

"I am indeed . What can you tell me ?"
"The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex ."
"Do I get a card ?"
"Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours ."
"How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account ."
"The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing ."
"That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ?"
"Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits ."

"It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password ."
"What do I do after I've typed in my password ?"
"Just press ENTER and you've done . "
"Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ?"
"We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider ."
"You can knock off another 2 % for that ."
"We can borrow as much as we can ."
"Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop ."
"How much loan capital can we safely raise then ?"
"I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . "

"Well , shall we get down to business ' ."
"Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?"
"Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now ."
"I'm very glad to hear that ."
"What's your best price for that item ?"
"The unit price is $ 12.50 ."
"I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it , I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 ."
"Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units ."
"Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith ."
"The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ?"
"Of course . "
"Excuse me , can you help me ? I would like to change rooms if possible , I couldn ’ t sleep at all last night , because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise , also if at all possible , I ’ d like a room that doesn ’ t overlook the street , between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside , I didn ’ t sleep a wink ."
"I am so sorry to hear that sir , let me check and see what is available , what room are you in now ?"
"I ’ m on the 6th floor , room 698 , I ’ v had many problems with that room , just this morning , I called someone up to fix the light fixture in the bathroom , it didn ’ t work , and it still doesn ’ t work ."
"Oh , dear , well , it looks like we have a few rooms available , can I put you into a room on the 17th floor ? It has a balcony and it doesn ’ t face the highway ."
"Ok , that would be very nice ! What do I need to do to transfer ?"
"Let me check you out of your old room , you have to sign here , and acknowledge these changes and also the charges to your previous room . Then I can hook you right up to room 1780 ."
"Mmm , I don ’ t think the charges are right , can you explain them please ? "
"Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 ."
"Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction ."
"Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school ."
"Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ?"
"Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York ."
"What did that involve ?"
"Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group ."
"I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?"
"Yes , okay . "
"You owe $ 36.78 ."
"Here ’ s my VISA card ."
"I ’ m sorry , but your card isn ’ t working ."
"What ’ s the problem ?"
"The machine says your card was declined ."
"It was ?"
"Do you have another card ?"
"That ’ s my only one ."
"Maybe you can just pay in cash ?"
"No cash today ."
"I guess you won ’ t be able to purchase these items today ."
"I ’ ll come tomorrow with cash . "
"Marriott Street ."
"How do you spell that ?"
"M , A , double R , I , O , double T ."
"Right . Got that . "
"Mary , we're going to the supermarket . Do you want to come ?"
"Yeah . I need to get some stuff ."
"Let's all go together then ."
"Where's Lisa ?"
"She's getting coupons from her desk ."
"What are coupons ?"
"They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy ."
"Really ?"
"Because there is a coupon for almost every product , we always bring coupons on our shopping trips . "
"Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?"
"Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins ."
"Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?"
"Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up ."
"Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers ."
"You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !"
"You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ?"
"You ’ re so picky sometimes ."
"Here you go , honey , fried eggs ."
"Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . "
"Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters ."
"Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ?"
"Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week ."
"Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ?"
"Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd ."
"Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ?"
"That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm ."
"Great . Talk to you then . "
"If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places ."
"Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... , Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ?"
"Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time ."
"How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way ."
"So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . "
"Hi , Steven , take a seat ! How are things at work ?"
"It's coming along well , but it is a little delayed ."
"Can you finish it on time ?"
"I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me ."
"OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay ."
"OK , we promise to do it well . "
"OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed ."
"Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ?"
"Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything ."
"I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ?"
"Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector ."
"So how do you intend to do that ?"
"OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions ."
"May I interrupt you for a moment ?"
"Go ahead ."
"How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ?"
"Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it ."
"I see . OK . So what ’ s next ?"
"Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . "
"Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ?"
"Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday ."
"What's he studying ?"
"He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA ."
"Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ?"
"The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him ."
"Why is that ?"
"He just has his secretary do his homework for him . "
"Hello , reservation desk . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I ’ d like to book a duplex suite ."
"What day would you like to reserve the suite for , sir ?"
"Next Friday ."
"I ’ m sorry , sir . We can ’ t accept reservations for next Friday due to over booking . May I suggest another hotel , sir ?"
"Oh , thank you very much ."
"Please hold the line . I ’ ll see if there is a duplex suite available on that day . ( a minute later ) Sir ? Holiday Inn is available for your need ."
"How do I contact them ?"
"I ’ ll give you their phone number . It ’ s 601 789 5634 . "
"Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan ."
"This is Ryan . How may I help you ?"
"Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather ."
"Do you know what the problem is ?"
"I have a horrible rash from poison oak ."
"Have you had it a long time ?"
"The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days ."
"Have you been using anything for it ?"
"I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine ."
"That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow . "
"Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ?"
"Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now ."
"Do you think any studios will open up soon ?"
"No , not for a few months . "
"Hi , Nancy . How are you doing ?"
"Hi , Tom . Want a cup of coffee ?"
"Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up ."
"Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ?"
"You mean used cars ?"
"No , Ah ... single sellers ."
"Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problems ."
"Uh huh . How about a used car ? They've got good ones now ."
"It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get ."
"Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now . You'd feel so good driving a new car ."
"Let's look at them all . Have you got a paper there ? "
"Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you ."
"Like who ?"
"Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com ."
"I've got it under control ."
"You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ?"
"What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ?"
"That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . "
"Good morning , how have you been doing ?"
"I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why ."
"Have you had any type of bug lately ?"
"No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe ."
"Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ?"
"No one has ever checked me for allergies ."
"Does this happen more when you are under stress ?"
"When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse ."
"I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma ."
"Thank you for pursuing this . I appreciate your help . "
"Let's go to Wangfujing by bus ."
"Better take the subway . It's faster , and more convenient ."
"OK , it will be a new experience for me ."
"We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy ."
"Where do we pay the fare ?"
"Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token . Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in ."
"Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ?"
"Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . It's free fo charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations ."
"Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?"
"No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . "
"Do you know the restrictions about the carry-on items for exiting ?"
"Yes , you can take small sum of money and important items such as passport and keys and business documents and so on ."
"What are the things that are forbidden to take in departure ?"
"There is a long list of those things forbidden , including explosives , gum opium and precious cultural relies and so on . "
"How are you , Sue ?"
"Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published ."
"Congratulations on your success ."
"Thank you ."
"And how ’ s your brother ?"
"He is fine ."
"He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?"
"Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa ."
"Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations ."
"Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . "
"Excuse me , can I have your passport , your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form , please ?"
"OK . Here you are ."
"How long will you be staying at Hotel in China ?"
"About three weeks ."
"And what's the purpose of your visit ?"
"Sightseeing ."
"And where will you be staying ?"
"At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing ."
"OK . Could you put your hand baggage on the counter , please ? Do you have any gifts , or food in here ?"
"Yes , I have some fresh apples in my suitcase ."
"I'm sorry , sir , you can't bring fresh fruit into China . I'm going to have to confiscate these ."
"Oh , that's too bad . "
"You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ?"
"Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process ."
"That's not as complicated as you suppose ."
"Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ?"
"It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field ."
"Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ?"
"Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle ."
"Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ?"
"Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . "
"Hello sir , how can I help you ?"
"Yes , I need this prescription please ."
"Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?"
"Capsules are fine ."
"Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol !"
"Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose !"
"Okay , anything else I can get you ?"
"Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ?"
"Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system ."
"Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem ."
"Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on ” Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ” please ! "
"I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step ."
"How many workers are there on the lines ?"
"About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day ."
"Oh , it's highly efficient ."
"Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development ."
"How do you control the quality of the products ?"
"Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration ."
"Yes , quality is even more than the quantity ."
"Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . "
"Good evening , sir . I think we have reservations . Have you fixed them ?"
"Let me see . Your name , please ?"
"My name is Paul Harper . "
"We ’ re asking for donations today ."
"What are you collecting donations for ?"
"We ’ re trying to raise money for the campaigns ."
"How much are you planning on raising ?"
"As much as possible ."
"What kind of fundraisers are you doing ?"
"We are going door to door ."
"You should try actual fundraisers , too ."
"What else can we do ?"
"Try having a car wash or selling candy ."
"I didn ’ t think of that ."
"I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . "
"Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ?"
"Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ?"
"I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds ."
"Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ?"
"We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant ."
"I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often ."
"Why is it relatively expensive ?"
"Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries ."
"I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country ."
"We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket ."
"Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine ."
"A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . "
"Yes , sir ?"
"Could we have the bill , please ?"
"That's 68 pounds altogether , please ."
"That's alright . Here you are . "

"We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks ."
"How ’ d it go ? Did we win ?"
"Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game . "
"Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it ."
"I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends ."
"Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?"
"I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ?"
"I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own ."
"Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job !"
"Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return ."
"Yeah , I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money . "
"Alpha Beta Courier Service ? This is Louise Walker calling from The Marketing Company ."
"Good morning , Ms . Walker . What can I do for you ?"

"Yes ."
"OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ?"
"Yes . "
"Welcome to our factory ."
"I've been looking forward to visiting your factory ."
"Actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along ."
"That'll be most helpful ."
"Maybe we could start with the Design Department . And then we could look at the production line ."
"How much do you spend on design development every year ."
"About 10 % of the gross sales ."
"That's fine . "
"Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ?"
"No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago ."
"You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ?"
"That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice ."
"Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ?"
"Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity ."
"This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ?"
"No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . "
"You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ?"
"Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good ."
"How many years have you been learning English ?"
"Oh , more than ten years . I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher ."
"Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it ."
"Certainly . "
"Hi . What can I get for you ?"
"I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please ."
"Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean ."

"No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs ."
"No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here ."
"Okay , is there anything else ?"
"Is this salami and bologna you have here ?"
"Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... , Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it ."
"Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... , Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today ."
"Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . "
"I ’ m reporting from Channel 5 News ."
"How are you doing ?"
"I want to ask you a couple questions ."
"Go for it ."
"Have you voted yet ?"
"I voted this morning ."
"Who was your vote for President ?"
"I can ’ t tell you that ."
"Why can ’ t you tell me ?"
"That is private information ."
"I see ."
"All I can tell you is our next President got my vote . "
"This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions ."
"If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off ."
"What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great ."
"I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ?"
"What is your proposal ?"
"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally ."
"Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ."
"What would you suggest ?"
"The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom ."
"That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed ."
"You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again ."
"I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting ."
"Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up ."
"What is it ?"
"My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently ."
"Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade ."
"I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ?"
"Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words ."
"Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ?"
"How about tomorrow morning at 9 ?"
"Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . "
"Mr . Smith just called me back ."
"So ?"
"We got the contract !"
"All right ! "
"How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ?"
"In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ?"
"Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report ."
"First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 ."
"Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ?"
"I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing ."
"So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ?"
"I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 ."
"Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ?"
"That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . "
"Could you please stop flipping the channels ?"
"I ’ m very sorry . "
"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus ."
"That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses ."
"It was silly of me to have taken a taxi ."
"At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ?"
"No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there ."
"Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year ."
"The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! "
"Is there a swimming pool in this hotel ?"
"We don't have a full-sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations ."
"What exactly does that mean ?"
"Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim ."
"That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?"
"If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations ."
"Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ?"
"To conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7a . m . till 10 ."
"I'll go down there as soon as I can !"
"I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . "
"So that will be one teddy , two terry cloth robes , three pairs of satin slippers , and two pairs of pajamas ."
"Does all that come to 10,000 NT ?"
"Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application ."
"Where do I sign ?"
"Right here . And write your address . You'll get the card in the mail within a week ."
"OK ."
"I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear ."
"Well , the teddy bear is for me !"
"Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges . There are no refunds on sale items . "
"My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ?"
"Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago ."
"Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know ."
"Thanks , I appreciate that ! "
"Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ?"
"Yes , I did , Ms . Chen ."
"That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ?"
"I'm positive , Ms . Chen . "
"John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ?"
"Is Mr Li in ?"
"Yes , but let me check if he's available ."
"Ok . "
"your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?"
"I bought it online ."
"really ? Do you often shop online ?"
"yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online ."
"I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?"
"yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home ."
"sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier ."
"and you can still go "" window shopping "" just like in a real shopping mall ."
"well , are there any other advantages ?"
"yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere ."
"are there many choices of online shopping ?"
"sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of ."
"perhaps I should have a try . "
"I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ?"
"The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents ."
"There you go ."
"Thank you , ma'am . Forty-three cents change . Have a nice day . "
"I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much ."
"I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting ."
"I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?"
"The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m ."
"( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb ."
"I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full ."
"What do you think of the leading actors ?"
"Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type ."
"You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . "
"Traffic rules are different among countries ."
"For example ?"
"People drive on the right in China ."
"Oh , that's interesting ! "
"Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ?"
"She's Betty.She ' s Mr Goldman's niece ."
"Would you love to introduce me to her ?"
"Yes , I'll be glad to . "
"Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ?"
"Yes , I am ."
"I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you ."
"Glad to see you too . "
"Hi Sam ."
"Hi Chris . I am glad to see you . Can you help me with my new computer ?"
"When did you buy your new computer ?"
"I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45 ."
"So what's the problem ?"
"I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net ."
"Can I have a look ?"
"Of course , come in ."
"Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks . How much did you pay ?"
"It was only 345 pounds ."
"Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time ."
"I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ?"
"That will be perfect . "
"Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ?"
"Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be online in a heartbeat ."
"Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only ."
"No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives ."
"Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are ."
"Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor ."
"Great ! But is it free ?"
"Sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee ."
"You said there were other alternatives ?"
"Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless ."
"Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ?"
"We might have a printer here next month . But for now , you'll have to go to the lab . "
"Why have you decided to change jobs ?"
"I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank ."
"Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ?"
"Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here ."
"It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field ."
"I expect to work hard , madam ."
"Do you mind going on frequent business trips ?"
"No , I enjoy travelling . "
"One of my students told me she was very depressed today ."
"Why ?"
"Her father is dying ."
"Oh , that ’ s very sad ."
"Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid ."
"What did you do ?"
"I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her ."
"That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things ."
"Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own ."
"Yeah , me too . "
"I'm very annoyed at your disobedience ."
"But mum , I didn't mess it up ."
"You should have asked for my opinion before you did it ."
"Sorry , mum . I won't do it again ."
"You'd better remember your promise . "
"Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent ."
"We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate ."
"That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase ."
"Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ?"
"I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales ."
"Well , we'll consider your proposal . "
"Hey , don ’ t walk on the lawn ."
"Sorry , I ’ m looking for my wallet ."
"You lost your wallet ? Anything important in it ?"
"Yes . A lot of cash . Almost forty thousand pounds ."
"Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there ."
"It seems that is a better way . Thank you ."
"You are welcome . "
"Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight ."
"That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread !"
"That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . "
"Shall we share a taxi ?"
"Where are you heading now ?"
"I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house ."
"Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?"
"That's the one ."
"You mean we'll share the taxi ?"
"Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully ."
"Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . "
"Good morning . What seems to be the problem ?"
"Good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ?"
"I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ?"
"Yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days ."
"Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest ."
"OK . I can afford to take a few days off work ."
"Have you been working hard recently ?"
"Yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little ."
"Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ?"
"I have a bad headache , but ... , Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription ."
"Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . "
"Hi , I'm John Sandals , and I have a reservation ."
"Would you show me your ID , sir , please ?"
"Here you go ."
"Thank you very much . Now , sir , do you have a credit card ?"
"Certainly ! Would you like my American Express card ?"
"Regrettably , Mr . Sandals , we accept only MasterCard or VISA ."
"I thought American Express was accepted everywhere . Never mind . Here's my VISA ."
"Thanks . You're in room 507 , a big , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . Is that okay , sir ?"
"Yes , that's just fine ."
"I'm happy to hear that . Here is your key . Just dial 0 if you need anything . "
"Good evening , Yanking Restaurant ."
"Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ?"
"Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ?"
"For two people . We would like a quiet table , please ."
"Of course . May I have your name , please ?"
"This is Mr . William ."
"Can you spell that , please ?"
"William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M ."
"Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . "
"Hello , Frank ."
"Hi , Steven . What's new with you ?"
"Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment ."
"Why ?"
"I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off ."
"What happened ? Did you have a fight ?"
"No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room ."
"I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ?"
"Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him ."
"It's a problem . You'd better move . "
"Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify ."
"Which terms ?"
"First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America ."
"Good . I will add this to the contract ."
"The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer ."
"Well , you are right . Is there anything else ?"
"As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much ."
"Well , we have agreed on all the major points . "
"Can you shorten this pipe for me ? It's too long ."
"Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ?"
"Can you take 15 mm of it ?"
"Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m . "
"Most people in Montreal speak French ."
"Are there any people who speak English ?"
"Only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak English . "
"Good evening . Where have you come from ?"
"Bucharest , Romania ."
"May I have your passport and form I - 94 , please ?"
"Here you are ."
"What's the nature of your visit ? Business or pleasure ?"
"Pleasure . I'm visiting my relatives ."
"How long are you going to stay in the United States ?"
"Three weeks ."
"What is your occupation ?"
"I work as an accountant for a Romanian telecommunications company ."
"Do you have a return ticket ?"
"Yes , here it is ."
"That's fine . Thanks . Enjoy your trip ."
"Thank you . "
"You have been so busy these months . What are you up to ?"
"You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it "
"What'll it be today , sir ?"
"Fill it up . Super Unleaded ."
"Shall we check your oil and tires ?"
"I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires ."
"( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 ."
"I'll charge it . Here's my card . "
"What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ?"
"In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful ."
"But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city ."
"Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . "
"What do you think about our company ?"
"You are the leading company in the computer industry ."
"Why do you think so ?"
"First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none ."
"In what business are you most interested in this organization ?"
"In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field . "
"Excuse me , do you have any English songs ?"
"Yes , we do . They are all in this book ."
"Great , thanks ."
"No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers !"
"Oh , I see . "
"Hi , I have a reservation under the name of Sandals ."
"Could I see your ID , please , sir ?"
"Of course ! Let me take it out of my wallet ."
"Thank you , sir . Now , do you have a credit card , sir ?"
"Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ?"
"I'm sorry , sir . Only VISA or MasterCard ."
"In that case , here's my VISA ."
"Thank you . Your room number is 507 , queen bed , nonsmoking . Is that agreeable to you , sir ?"
"Yes , I'm easy to please ."
"Very good . Here is your room key , sir . If you need anything at all , please dial 0 . "
"Can I help you , Miss ?"
"Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ?"
"What is your skin type ?"
"My skin is kind of oily ."
"This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand ."
"How much is it ?"
"$ 60.The price is reasonable for its large quantity . What's more , there are some gifts attaching for you ."
"Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ?"
"You can take one tonic or hand cream ."
"I will choose the tonic ."
"No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it ."
"That's the very thing I want . "
"May I know the definite date of delivery ?"
"Let me check.Well , in October ."
"Is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment ?"
"We assure you that shipment will be made no later than the first half of October . "
"We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance ."
"Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... , Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ?"
"No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price ."
"So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday ."
"Great ! "
"Have you been to the Queen Street West ?"
"No . What is that street charming for ?"
"You can find the most fashionable restaurants there . And also you can see the galleries , antique shops and the ballrooms . "
"Welcome to Jinyuan Shoe Town . What can I do for you ?"
"I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans ."
"White ? What make do you want ? Arid what size ?"
"Adidas . Size 38 ."
"Adidas ? They wear well . Try this pair , Size 38 , please ."
"Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ?"
"Okay . What about this one ?"
"( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ?"
"You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there ."
"OK . Thank you . "
"R :: Good morning . Room Reservations . May I help you ?"

"R :: Mr . Aaron Johnson , phone number is 3242-5827 . Excuse me , how do you spell your first name ?"
"It ’ s double A , R , O , N ."
"Double A , R , O , N . Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I know your arrival time on April 16th ?"
"Around 9 p . m ."
"Mr . Johnson , for the unguaranteed reservation , we can only hold the room by 6 p . m ."
"because it is the peak season now . If you make a guaranteed reservation , we can hold the room overnight . Would you like to make a guaranteed reservation by credit card ?"
"Fine . Do you accept American Express ?"
"Yes . May I know the number ?"

"Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ?"
"Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu ."
"Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” ."
"Ahhhhhhhh , Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ?"
"A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible ."
"Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs !"
"Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ?"
"Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies !"
"Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it !"
"Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care ."
"Thanks doc , bye ! "
"What schools have you attended ?"
"I finished Young Primary School in 1998 , and entered Xi ’ an Middle School that same September . I graduated from there in July of 2004 , and that September I entered Wuhan University , where I'm studying now ."
"How do you think the education you have received will contribute to your work in this company ?"
"I think I have a good understanding of fundamentals in the areas your company deals with , and I can go on from here to build up the specific skills and knowledge I need to do my job well ."
"Your graduation thesis was on Medical Application of Laser , right ? What were your conclusions ?"
"Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . "
"How much are you planning to buy ?"
"Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping !"
"Cool ! Can I come ?"
"No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... , But not enough space for me ?"
"Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... , Billy ... "
"But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play ."
"What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk ."
"Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them . "
"Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you ."
"I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ?"
"I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in ."
"All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? "
"Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade ."
"Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft ."
"Do you have some points to bring up ?"
"Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here ."
"Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ?"
"I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ?"
"It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? "
"In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you ."
"It's our pleasure ."
"Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . "
"Hello . What can I do for you today ?"
"I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong ."
"Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ?"
"Very carefully , that's when I found the problem ."
"Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ?"
"Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ?"
"Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone ."
"That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . "
"Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency ."
"Good morning . I'm calling to ask if you have a vacant apartment ."
"Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ?"
"I prefer a one-bedroom apartment ."
"Are you renting it alone or with company ?"
"I'll share it with one of my friends . What ’ s in a one-bedroom apartment ?"
"A one-bedroom apartment has one bedroom , a living room , a kitchen and a bathroom ."
"Is there any furniture ?"
"No , but a fridge and a stove ."
"It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ?"
"Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit ."
"When can I come over ?"
"Would Friday morning be alright ?"
"OK . Good-bye ."
"Good-bye . "
"May I have a reservation ?"
"Yes , of course ."
"I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window ."
"All right . Your name , please ."
"I'm Chen Liang ."
"Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ?"
"We may come at 6:30 p . m ."
"OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?"
"No , I'm not clear ."
"we've spent $ 1,000 ."
"Don't make a fuss.The price is rising "
"What kind of qualities should a secretary have ?"
"First , she needs to be hard-working . Second , she has to be able to do a lot ot things on her own initiative ."
"I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian ."
"Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company . "
"When will we leave here ?"
"I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . "
"Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great !"
"You ’ re welcome . Would you like some cold dishes ?"
"Let me see . How about the lotus root ?"
"Ok , and anything to drink ? Maybe some jasmine tea ?"
"Oh , yes that would be nice ."
"And for your main course ? I can recommend the sizzling beef ."
"Actually , I ’ m vegetarian so I ’ d like to have the bean curd ."
"Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too . "
"Have you had any experience with sales work ?"
"Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms ."
"What exactly did you do at that company ?"
"Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that ."
"Did you like your work ?"
"Yes , I did ."
"But when and why did you leave the company ?"
"I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development ."
"I see . Why did you choose our company ?"
"I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . "
"Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ?"
"Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower ."
"Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ?"
"You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online ."
"Are there many things online ?"
"Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online !"
"Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ?"
"Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here ."
"Really ? How to do that ?"
"Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction ."
"That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ?"
"Let's click to check it out ."
"Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets ."
"No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits ."
"Are there any disadvantages about it ?"
"It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon . "
"This apartment is wonderful ."
"I ’ m glad you like it ."
"How much would I have to pay for rent ?"
"The rent is $ 1050 each month ."
"That ’ s way too much money ."
"It isn ’ t too much ."
"How about if I pay $ 850 ?"
"I can ’ t take that ."
"I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 ."
"I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you ."
"You can ’ t go any lower than that ?"
"If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal . "
"Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ?"
"I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory ."
"Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week ."
"That sounds all right ."
"Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... "
"What do you think are the main causes of war today ?"
"I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force ."
"It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country ."
"several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end ."
"How do you think they could be ended ?"
"I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro , So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them ."
"It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries ."
"Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive ."
"The problem is that many poor people might suffer . "
"Look ! Allen has the mike !"
"I thought he only liked to listen ?"
"That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias !"
"And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! "
"Do you have anything to declare ?"
"No . I have nothing ."
"Are these all your personal things ?"
"Yes , they are ."
"Please open the black case ."
"OK . "
"So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ?"
"I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university ."
"And how do you like working for IBM ?"
"It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot ."
"What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ?"
"I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others ."
"That ’ s good . We always need team players here . "
"Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ?"
"Yes . My home freezer is not working properly ."
"What ’ s the problem ?"
"It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted ."
"Maybe the compressor is going bad ."
"Can you send the technician to check it out ?"
"Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge ."
"Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges ."
"All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ?"
"My number is 627-555-1234 ."
"Okay . I ’ ll call you right back ."
"Thank you . Good bye ."
"Bye . "
"I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden !"
"What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening !"
"On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject ."
"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?"
"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools ."
"What type of tools ?"
"You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe ."
"Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?"
"I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !"
"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! "
"Have you seen Bill recently ?"
"Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now ."
"Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood ."
"You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ?"
"He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold ."
"He might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy ."
"I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow ."
"It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look ."
"Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling ."
"That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand ."
"Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . "
"What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ?"
"I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account ."
"That certainly is quite an accomplishment ."
"Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account ."
"What's your sales record been like there ?"
"The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years ."
"If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ?"
"Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on . "
"Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ?"
"Haven't been sleeping well recently ."
"What's the problem ?"
"Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings ."
"Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down ."
"Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon ."
"I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody ."
"Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . "
"Welcome to our factory . My name is Tiang Had and I'll show you around here.First we'll take a look at the workshop which produces food thermometers . Please , this way ."
"Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ?"
"Yes , it has ."
"Excuse me , what is this ?"
"This is a circuit board ."
"Are the batteries in it made by your people ?"
"No , they are from other factories ."
"What kind of battery is it ?"
"It is lithium which can be used for over three years . "
"After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead ."
"Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ?"
"It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits ."
"So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ?"
"First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account ."
"OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . "
"Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses ."
"Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ?"
"Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?"
"Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so ."
"So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ?"
"Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon ."
"Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ?"
"Yes , please . "
"I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule ."
"Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this ."
"I realize that . We don ’ t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ?"
"Let me see . That ’ s no problem . I ’ ll see you then . "
"Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there ."
"Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris ."
"You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ?"
"Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number ."
"You can reach me at 13661306917 ."
"Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience ."
"That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage ."
"Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully ."
"I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . "
"Thank you for your application , Mr . Sweeney . Mr . Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week . Do you have time ?"
"Yes , ma ’ am . I could come in any day next week , except for Friday morning ."
"Fine . Let me take a look at his schedule . He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 . Could you come in then ?"
"Yes . That would be fine . "
"Hello , I would like to make an appointment to look at houses ."
"Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ?"
"I would prefer mornings ."
"Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ?"
"Going to look at houses during the week is best for me ."
"Where would you like me to pick you up ?"
"I will meet you at the real estate office ."
"I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours ."
"That sounds good to me ."
"Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule . "
"Something ’ s burning ?"
"Oh , my bread !"
"Mm , I love burnt bread ."
"Curse this oven ! Curse it !"
"But I prefer burnt bread ."
"Curse the worst oven in the world ."
"Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread !"
"There are thirteen of them . Oh , have another . Have a third , if you like , have them all . "
"Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ?"
"Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes ."
"May I buy a ticket here at the station ?"
"Sure ."
"Where ?"
"Go to window number eleven ."
"Thanks . "
"What kind of job are you interested in ?"
"I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work ."
"I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs ."
"Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday ."
"Have you had any experience as a guide ?"
"Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing ."
"Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing ."
"I think I would like that . "
"I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday ."
"What's it like ?"
"It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting !"
"And then ?"
"I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ?"
"That's neat ! "
"Oh , this is Monica , OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract ."
"Yes . Let's first define the inspection right ."
"Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival ."
"Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ?"
"Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment ."
"And can you tell me about the re-inspection ?"
"Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month ."
"I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ?"
"They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract ."
"What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ?"
"A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . "
"Do you often buy magazines ?"
"I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments ."
"Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?"
"Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes ."
"Do you have an online edition of that magazine ?"
"Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription ."
"Do you have a subscription ?"
"Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ?"
"I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . "
"Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is ."
"Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment ."
"Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair ."
"Does he have a moustache or a beard ?"
"Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard ."
"Sounds like Mike , is it ?"
"Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know ."
"Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are ."
"Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that ."
"Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree ."
"I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information ."
"She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too ."
"This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is ."
"She ’ s your mother !"
"How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?"
"I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now ."
"I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality ."
"Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! "
"Excuse me , I got a parcel arrival notice yesterday ."
"Would you show me your notice ?"
"Here you are ."
"Please endorse it first . Do you have identification ?"
"Yes , here is my ID card . "
"I put in two quarters for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine ."
"Really ? Let me check it ."
"I'm sure it's broken ."
"No , ma'am . I ’ m afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime . "
"I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon ."
"Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement ."
"Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days ."
"Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits ."
"Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees ."
"No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ?"
"We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % ."
"But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit ."
"Done ... "
"Doctor Ruth's office , may I help you ?"
"Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn ."
"Let's see , Mr . Horn ... The doctor's schedule is full today . Would tomorrow be all right ?"
"Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow ."
"Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ?"
"In the morning , if possible ."
"The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then ."
"That would be fine ."
"Okay , Mr . Horn , see you tomorrow at 10:30 . "
"The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching ."
"Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday ."
"How are you getting along with your studies ?"
"Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow ."
"But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . "
"Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I ... , NO !"
"I haven't even told you what it is yet !"
"Okay , okay , what do you want ?"
"Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to a concert tonight ."
"Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother ."
"Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him !"
"Who's this Eric guy ?"
"Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please !"
"No can do ... sorry ."
"Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?"
"No way !"
"That ’ s so unfair ! "
"When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ?"
"Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns ."
"If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns ."
"I will think about it . "
"Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ?"
"Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic ."
"Yeah , that is very important ."
"Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time ."
"I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done ."
"I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style ."
"Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ?"
"You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes ."
"I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . "
"OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people ."
"Really ? I'm glad to hear that ."
"That's true . And this trip has been a very productive one for us ."
"Thank you again for your visit . We are looking forward to your reply ."
"Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction ."
"We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other ."
"It ’ s very kind of you to say so ."
"You are very nice and helpful . Hope to see you again ."
"I think we will have opportunities to meet each other in the future ."
"OK , I think it's time for you to check in . If you run into any difficulty , we'll be here to assist you immediately ."
"Fine . Thank you very much . Bye-bye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Did you enjoy your meal ?"
"Yes , we really enjoyed it ."
"May I interest you in some dessert ?"
"Yes , that sounds great ."
"Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials ."
"The apple crisp sounds great ."
"Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ?"
"Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ?"
"Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ?"
"Let's have four coffees , please ."
"OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks ."
"Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here . "
"Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please ."
"Sure , what time will you like to depart ?"
"What time does the next train leave ?"
"Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five ."
"Ok , could you give me two tickets for that ?"
"Sure , that will be thirty-two dollars please . "
"Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college ."
"Don't mention it ."
"It's my greatest pleasure to have met you.See you around ."
"See you . "
"I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can't find a cheap plane ticket ."
"Have you tried the Internet ?"
"No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ?"
"Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom ."
"Well , you don't have to be mean . How do I do it ?"
"Go to www.yahoo.com and click on Travel and tickets . There are about a billion sites to look at ."
"Ok , thanks . I'll let you know what I find ."
"All right ."
"I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . Thanks ! "
"I'd like to rent a car for several days ."
"What kind of car do you want ?"
"Well , what kinds do you have ?"
"Mazda . Honda and Nissan ."
"Honda is OK . "
"You voted , right ?"
"You know I did ."
"Who did you vote for ?"
"I voted for Obama , of course !"
"Can you believe that he actually won ?"
"I knew he would win ."
"I didn ’ t think he would ."
"He was the top candidate ."
"I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American ."
"That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf ."
"You ’ re absolutely right ."
"I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . "
"Hello.Is this ABC Rent-a-car Company ?"
"Yes , speaking.May I help you ?"
"This morning we rented a car and we are on the way to Niagara Falls . I'm afraid we have a car accident near the border ."
"That's too bad.What kind of accident is it ? Are you all right ?"
"I'm all right , but my friend is seriously injured.Will you call an ambulance and the police ?"
"OK . I'll do it right away , but tell me how it happened ."
"I ran into the guardrail when I turned to the left . "
"Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas ."

"The best opportunity is called callous , which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of ."
"Do I have to have a computer at home ?"

"Do you have any other services available ?"
"We have information available about the job market as well as workshops ."

"I'm in the electrical appliances ."
"I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company ."
"Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation ."
"Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ?"
"Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets ."
"I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow ."
"That would be great . "
"Have you decided on something ?"
"Yes , please bring us two steaks ."
"Sure . Anything else ?"
"What vegetables come with the steaks ?"
"Potato chips and French dressing . "
"How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ?"
"I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview ."
"That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus ."
"It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship ."
"We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets ."
"Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute ."
"We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information ."
"We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable ."
"Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . "

"That's great . They must really be committed to staff development ."
"They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . "
"Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ?"
"Not bad . Everything goes well . "
"OK darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese !"
"Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food !"
"Humph ! Right , so what did you get ?"
"Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... , Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?"

"About two hours ago ."
"Why didn't you report it before ?"
"I couldn't . I was bound and gagged ."
"Please tell me exactly what happened ."
"I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it ."
"That wasn't very wise , sir ."
"I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her ."
"You should never open a door without looking to see who it is ."
"Yes , I know . I regret it very much ."
"What happened ?"
"Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me ."
"Did you get a good look at them ?"
"I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces ."
"What did they take ?"
"My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe ."

"Sure . Here is your receipt and you can draw your tax paid for those goods at customs . "
"Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ?"
"Sure . How about this one ?"
"Is this the latest edition ?"
"Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover ."
"What's the difference ?"
"The hardcover is more expensive ."
"Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please , "
"Is it possible that I have a business trip abroad and work in American once in a while ?"
"Yes . We are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad ."
"Is there any training program for the employees to make a further study ?"
"Sure . We attach great importance to the all-round development of the staff , and the development of individuals will motivate them to work more diligently and efficiently . "
"Hello , Lucy . This is Monica again . I have a question ."
"Please ask ."
"I was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer , an e-resume or a paper one ?"
"For this position we prefer e-resume at the very beginning . Please send it to our department ’ s e-mail box ."
"Ok , thank you ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ?"
"What do you want to know ?"
"The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent ."
"Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher ."
"Sounds as if you come from a professional family ."
"That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university ."
"What made you decide to get into computers ?"
"Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines ."
"Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ?"
"More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while ."
"It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week ."
"Thanks very much . "
"Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ?"
"Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth ."
"Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays ."
"Is it gonna hurt ?"
"No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . "
"Should I go now ?"
"Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas ."
"Nothing is happening !"
"First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive ."
"What do these other letters mean ?"
"R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . "
"Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all ."
"Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat ."
"Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own ."
"Don ’ mention it . I ’ m glad to help . "
"Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box ."
"I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ?"
"I think you are flicking through it ."
"Well , wait a minute . "
"Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ?"
"Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants ."
"Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ?"
"No , I need my books ."
"Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy ."
"Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less ."
"Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt ."
"All right . That sounds fair . "
"I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe ."
"Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully ."
"Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield ."
"The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . "
"Can I give you a lift home , Mrs . Word ?"
"That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you ."
"Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?"
"Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ?"
"Dreadful . There , the door is open now ."
"Thank you . "
"Um , which of them is the better typist ?"
"Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully ."
"Is there any difference in their short hand ?"
"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class ."
"How about languages ?"
"Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does ."
"Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . "
"Hi , Kerry . Did your husband make cooking for you ?"
"Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time ."
"Really ? Was it delicious ?"
"Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow ."
"It was the first time . You should not be so particular ."
"Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect ."
"It ’ s true . Nowadays , men are spending more and more time in the kitchen ."
"Yeah , it will become a wider trend . "
"Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company ."
"Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?"
"Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet ."
"Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? "
"This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight ."
"Would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ?"
"I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches !"
"Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course ."
"Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience ."
"Sir , our guests are our reason for being . "
"Hello , Steven , what are you doing now ?"
"I am preparing a birthday party for Julia ."
"Can I be of any help to you ?"
"Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ?"
"I hate balloons ."
"Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy ."
"No problem . "
"Hey , Jim , it ’ s time to wake up and get out of bed ."
"Do I have to get up now ?"
"You ’ d better get up , or you ’ ll be late ."
"What are you talking about ? My alarm hasn ’ t even gone off yet ."
"Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep ."
"I must have slept right through it ."
"Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !"
"Just let me sleep 5 more minutes ."
"The early bird gets the worm ."
"I know . I know . But I don ’ t want any worms ."
"Ha ! Ha ! If you don ’ t make an effort now , later on it ’ ll be a lot tougher for you . "
"That is what we are pursuing ."
"We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations ."
"A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff ."
"That will be good . "
"Are you going to vote this Tuesday ?"
"Yes , I am , and I am so excited ."
"Have you figured out who you ’ re going to vote for ?"
"I love my candidate ."
"Why is that ?"
"My candidate is probably the most intelligent ."
"Is that right ?"
"I also agree with all his policies ."
"That ’ s great !"
"I know he ’ s going to be the next President ."
"Hopefully , he will be ."
"I can ’ t wait to vote . "
"Have you met the new manager in customer service ?"
"No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ?"
"She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy !"
"You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did . "
"Is the new computerised stock system in operation ?"
"Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now ."
"Have all the operators been trained on it ?"
"Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . "
"What's the fare , please ?"
"Twenty dollars and sixty cents ."
"What ? You're overcharging me !"
"No way . Look . That's what the meter says ."
"Then something must be wrong with the meter . "
"Mom , I didn ’ t have breast . I could eat a horse ."
"Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . "
"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill ."
"I'm sorry . I won't do it again ."
"Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign ."
"Is this the sign ? What does it say ?"
"It says ' No smoking here ' . "
"Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down ."
"I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ?"
"B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ?"
"It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ?"
"Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week ."
"I will leave a memo for you , sir . "
"DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB ."
"Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted ."
"Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ?"
"I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . "
"How long has the company been in business ?"

"What does CABS stand for ?"
"International Air Braking Systems . "
"Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material ."
"Well , sir . Can I take your measurements first ?"
"Yes . Should I take off my coat ?"
"That'll be helpful . All right , thank you ."
"Please make a single-breasted ."
"No , problem . If you'll wait one moment , I'll make out your receipt ."
"How much does it cost ?"
"Let me see , with padding and lining cloth , it comes to 357 dollars altogether ."

"They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed ."
"Is the seed edible ?"
"Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it ."
"How much does a mango cost ?"
"Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each ."
"Maybe I won't like the taste ."
"It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity ."
"How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?"
"They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe ."
"Where do most of them come from ?"
"These are from Mexico . "
"Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ?"
"Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi !"
"Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that ."
"I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?"
"Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you ."
"So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ?"
"To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time ."
"Like this ?"
"Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist ."
"Did I do it right ?"
"No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing ."
"What should I do with my legs then ?"
"Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another ."
"Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ?"
"Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . "
"These are new arrivals ."
"Let me have a look ."
"Try them if you like ."

"They are too bright . "

"Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ?"
"I was wondering when trash collection day was ."
"It ’ s on Tuesdays and Fridays ."

"Oh , o . k . Where ’ s that ?"
"It ’ s at the corner of that street ."
"Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ?"
"Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ’ ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill ."
"All right . Thanks a lot ."
"No problem . "
"We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on ."
"Why ?"
"Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better ."
"Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out ."
"Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month ."
"That's $ 1 825 ."

"Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ?"
"Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants ."
"Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook ."
"All right . "
"Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes ."

"Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... , Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?"
"I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube ."
"Looks like the TV wins that argument ."
"Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?"
"Sure , why not ? "
"This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean !"
"Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup ."
"OK , OK ."
"And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again ."

"Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! "

"None , I guess . My only passion is on reading . "
"By the way , where's Jim ?"
"He is out . "
"How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ?"
"Easy . View the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . Many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting ."
"Which websites are most popular ?"
"21st Talent Website , 51 Job , and Zhaopin.com are most popular . "
"Is your application successful ?"
"Yes , they notify me to work next week ."
"Where on earth will you work in ?"

"My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours ."
"That ’ s rather hard ."
"But it matches my major ."
"How will you get your pay ?"
"My wage depends on production results ."
"What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ?"
"The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy ."
"Is there a union ?"
"There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management ."
"So you must consider dearly before you go to work ."
"I will . "
"Welcome to Lincoln Bank . How may we be of service ?"

"OK , do you have the relevant materials ?"
"Yes , yes , we do . Right here ."

"Are you still working ?"
"My employer cut back on my hours ."
"If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours , you may qualify ."

"I see you just graduated from college . What was your GPA ?"

"I participated in several extracurricular activities . And I worked 2 jobs to put myself through school ."
"Wo , wo , that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on . "
"We hope that partial shipment is allowed ."
"Could you explain in detail ?"
"Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments ."
"How about 60 % for the first load , then 20 % each ? "
"The negotiation of the price has taken us a long time . I hope the following negotiation about quality will be quicker ."
"I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations ."
"Don't worry . Our quality is based solely on our sales samples ."
"But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ?"
"We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones ."
"That's great . "

"That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ?"
"Yes , it's right over here ."
"Great . One last question , where is your jazz section ?"
"Back there against that wall ."
"Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help ."
"No problem . "
"Mr . Smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle A5 , FOB Qingdao ?"
"Can You tell me how many you want to buy ?"
"100 for immediate delivery , and 500 in two months time.that ' s by the end of July , Well . then , 260 yuan each ."
"Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount ."
"I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price ."
"Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products ."
"OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ?"
"I think I can accept that . "
"Good afternoon , need any help ?"

"Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... , So how can you stand the heat ?"
"Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . "
"Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ?"
"I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year ."
"That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show ."
"Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ?"
"No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing ."

"The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments !"
"Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it ."
"Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? !"
"OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! "
"Are you going somewhere ?"
"Yes , I ’ m off to the department store . I must buy some furniture for my new flat ."
"Really ? Well you ’ ll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today ."

"( 2 minutes later ) Mr . Lin , Mr . Charles can see you now . This way , please . "
"Have you ever served in any international trading company ?"

"how much are you looking to spend ?"
"I can only afford about 300 pounds a month ."

"really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room ."
"well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !"
"do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?"
"I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ?"
"I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get !"
"how long do you want to sign a contract for ?"
"I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that ."
"do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?"
"I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished ."
"you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?"
"no , I thought that would be included in the rent ."
"it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities ."
"I don't think I can afford that ."
"don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children ."
"that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . "
"Did your meal meet with your approval ?"
"Our meal was absolutely perfect !"
"How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ?"
"Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends ."
"On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp ."
"I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful ."
"One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ?"
"We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ?"
"How about some coffee and tea as well ?"
"We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas ."
"I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away ."

"What about jeans ? It's the fashion now ."
"I don't like it . Actually I am looking slacks ."
"Then , how about this ?"
"It seems all right . Do you have pantaloons ? "
"Hey there , how are you doing ?"
"I am great . How are you ?"
"Well , I got laid off , and I ’ m looking for work ."
"Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ?"
"Right now , I ’ ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage ."
"Have you gone out on any interviews so far ?"

"Yeah , that'll be fine ."
"That's great . This is your key , sir . If you need anything at all , anytime , just dial zero . "
"I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime ."
"Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ?"
"No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office ."
"He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays ."
"We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management ."
"I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help ."
"That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . "
"Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ?"
"Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on the scale ."
"Your luggage is overweight . The free allowance for luggage is 20 kilos ."
"Oh , can I keep this little suitcase as hand-luggage ?"
"OK , in this way it's just below the limit ."
"Here's your ticket and your boarding card ."
"All right . I will begin boarding soon . "
"Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ?"
"Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets ."
"The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ?"
"Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for ."
"That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ?"
"No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . "
"Hi , I'd like to get your store credit card ."
"Here's the application form ."
"I'm finished . Here's the form ."
"Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card ."
"Here's my VISA ."
"Thank you . "
"I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us ."

"Long Distance . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to place an overseas call to London . Can I dial direct ?"
"No , sir . I'm afraid not ."

"You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens ."
"Is she available ?"
"One moment , please , and I will connect your call . "
"Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ?"
"Here you go ."
"I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems ."
"Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ?"
"We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight ."

"That's fine . I'll do that then ."
"Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . "

"An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?"
"Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try ."
"Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD ."
"That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products ."
"That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much ."
"Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 ."
"That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?"
"256MB ."
"Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . "
"Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it ."
"It is called Energy Collector ."
"Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ?"

"So you can prove you are a man ."
"Bingo !"
"It's just you ! "
"John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today ."
"How so ? I thought it went fine ."
"I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions ."
"I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . "
"Do you like shopping ?"
"Yeah . I go shopping once a week , Why don't you do your shopping at home ?"
"What do you mean ? I can't understand ."
"I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce ."
"Really ? That's unbelievable . "
"Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?"
"umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday ."
"Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ?"
"No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss ."
"Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?"
"That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous ."
"Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece ."

"Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... , Perhaps you could give her a ring ?"
"Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous ."
"Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !"
"Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question !"
"Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . "
"What are you doing , Janice ?"
"I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work , Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ?"
"Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark ."
"You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ?"
"I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you ."
"So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem ."
"The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles ."
"Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ?"
"Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department ."
"How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ?"
"15 years . "
"Cheers ! Let ’ s tie one on ."
"Right , drink as much as you can . "
"I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket ."

"No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ?"
"Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom ."
"Well , you don ’ t have to be mean . How do I do it ?"
"Go to yahoo.com and click on “ Travel ” and “ Tickets . ” They ’ ll be about a billion sites to look at ."
"O . K . Thanks . I ’ ll let you know what I find ."
"All right ."
"I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . "
"What kind of person do you think you are ?"
"Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality ."
"What are your strengths and weaknesses ?"
"Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect ."
"What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?"
"To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive ."
"How do you spend your leisure time ?"
"I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies ."
"So , what kind of sport do you like most ?"
"Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . "
"I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something ."
"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?"
"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty ."
"is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey ."
"but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?"
"of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . "
"What would my new duties be ?"
"Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees ."
"Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while ?"
"Yes , you definitely will . "
"When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ?"
"We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ?"
"Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 ."
"Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days ."
"I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away ."
"I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much ."
"I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you ."
"We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ?"
"I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ?"
"Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation ."
"Thank you very much . "
"Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face !"
"Recently it's been pretty good , actually ."
"That's what we like to hear , a profitable business ."
"Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment ."
"So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ?"

"Yes , I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries ."
"Would you like anything to drink with that ?"
"Yes , a medium Coke ."
"Will that be all ?"
"Yes ."
"For here or to go ?"
"To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . ) , That'll be $ 4 . 25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . "
"Good morning , this is Mary ."
"Good morning , this is Jane . This is Apple Co . Ltd ."
"Hello , Jane ! Is that the Human Resource Department ?"
"Yes , this is . May I help you ?"
"I had an interview with your company two weeks ago . I am calling to ask about the interview result . I hope you can give me a positive reply ."
"Oh , the results have come out , and I can tell you ... Yes , I find your name . You are hired . Congratulations !"
"Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ?"
"Next Monday morning ."
"What is the starting salary for me ?"
"Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher ."
"I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then !"
"See you ! "
"Good morning . May I help you ?"
"I'd like to rent a car , please ."
"Okay . Full-size , mid-size or compact , ma'am ?"
"Full-size , please . What's the rate ?"
"78 dollars a day with unlimited mileage ."
"And I'd like to have insurance just in case ."
"Is there an additional driver ?"
"No ."
"If you want full coverage insurance , it will be 8 dollars per day . It includes collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance ."
"All right . I'll take it ."
"Here is our brochure , ma'am . Err ... full-size ... OK . Please choose a model in this section ."
"How about this one ?"
"All right . How many days would you like to use it ?"
"Just one day ."
"May I see your driver's license and credit card please ?"
"Is the international driving licence fine ?"
"Yes , it is . ( ... ) Thank you . Please fill in this form . Can you check this box , and put your initials here , and again here . "
"Did you hear who won the election ?"
"No , who was it ?"
"McCain is our new President ."
"You ’ re a liar !"
"I ’ m not happy about it , either ."
"Who voted for him ?"
"I guess the people wanted him as our new leader ."
"That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard ."
"I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like ."
"What could be worse than what you just told me ?"
"I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected ."
"That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . "
"Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ?"
"I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel ."
"Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason ."
"Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing ."
"I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?"
"Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that ."
"It's not a simple thing to be beautiful ."
"Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?"
"Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !"
"Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne ."
"Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it ."
"It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly ."
"That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?"
"No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft ."
"How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her ."
"I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . "
"Maybe you should have told me first ?"
"Why ?"
"Because we're partners ."
"I realize that but I needed to make a decision . "
"Excuse me ."
"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?"
"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare ."
"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order ."
"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?"
"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes ."
"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . "
"You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year ."
"Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed ."
"Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one ."
"If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu ."
"Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . "
"( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?"
"Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality ."
"As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?"
"To begin with , I have to use chopsticks ."
"But you look quite proficient in using them now ."
"Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table ."
"Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !"
"Anything strange about that ?"
"Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present ."
"Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . "
"Do you two know each other ?"
"Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university . "
"Can you help me , please ?"
"Sure , if I can , I want to send this small parcel to Canada ."
"By airmail or seamail ?"
"How different are these rates ?"
"Your parcel weights 420 grams . So it is 21.3 dollars by air , or 6.9 dollars by sea ."
"How long it will take by sea ?"
"About a month ."
"Then , by sea , please ."
"Please fill out this form , and then take your parcel to the counter on my left-hand side ."
"All right . Thank you very much ."
"Not at all . "
"We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ?"
"How about some Zongzi ?"
"What is that ?"
"Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves ."
"That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that ."
"Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too ."
"OK . We will try some ."
"Anything else ?"
"No , it's enough ."
"OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes ."
"OK . Thank you . "
"How much is the hat ?"
"$ 10 ."
"I have seen this cheaper in other places ."
"Well , what about $ 8 ? Take it or leave it . "
"Could you give us a detailed description of the properties of your product ?"
"OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office ."
"Could you tell me more about it ?"
"Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned ."
"Can you introduce its price level to me ?"
"We have this item in three price level ."
"We need the best possible quality ."
"That means this one ."
"I see , that's what I will order . "
"Hi , Susan !"
"Hi , Lily ! How is everything ?"
"Not so well . I've come down with the flu ."
"I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself ."
"Thank you . "
"What are you doing ?"
"I'm watching TV ."
"Are there any good programs on TV ?"
"Tingling is on TV ."
"Which Channel is it ?"
"Channel 8 ."
"It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? "
"Will you book a ticket to New York for me ?"
"Yes , sir.When do you want to leave here ?"
"This Saturday ."
"Will , that'll be the sixth of September ."
"That's right.Will you check what fights are available on the sixth of September ?"
"I'll check it over.Oh , there're three flights available that day.one at 2 p . m ."
"one at 5 p . m . and the other at 9p . m ."
"I'll have the 5 o'clock one.What time do I check in ?"
"4 o'clock ."
"Thank you . "
"How often do you service the pump ?"
"We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month ."
"How do you decide how often these things need to be done ?"
"Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! "
"Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal ."
"Shall I come to your office this afternoon ?"
"That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? "
"I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ?"
"Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing ."
"Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract ."
"Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % ."
"Very good . How many goods do you have ?"
"Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ?"
"We want to order 900 dozen ."
"The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . "
"What ’ s your major weak point ?"
"I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience ."
"What are you greatest strength ?"
"Honest , hardworking and responsible ."
"Does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?"
"No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand . "
"Have you seen the news today ?"
"Not yet . What happened ?"
"Did you know there was a blackout last night ?"
"Yes , I heard the lights were out all night ."
"Well , some people decided to loot last night ."
"I don't understand ."
"They took advantage of the blackout ."
"They really started looting ?"
"Yes , apparently four stores were broken into ."
"Did the looters get caught ?"
"There was no evidence of who did it ."
"Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts . "
"Hello !"
"Hello , is Doris available ?"
"This is Doris . Who's calling please ?"
"Hi , Doris , this is Mike calling from Parker's Dentistry . I'm calling to confirm your appointment for tomorrow morning at 9 am with Dr.Parker ."
"Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early ."
"If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ?"
"It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ?"
"Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ?"
"That ’ s alright , . I think I should be able to make it at one fifteen . Can you put me down for that time slot ?"
"No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen ."
"Wonderful . Thanks very much . "
"Good morning ."
"Er , good morning , yes , er ... , I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night ."
"Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ?"
"Oh , Candida Fawcett ."
"Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ?"
"Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know ."
"Really , hmmmm.Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ?"
"Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... , Where exactly have you been working , please ? "
"You must be Mr White from Britain ."
"Yes , may I know your name ?"
"I'm Michael Smith from Eale Corporation.Pleased to meet you . "
"There ’ re traffic jams everywhere ."
"I think something must be done ."
"Yeah . We should have more roads built ."
"I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . "
"Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ?"
"Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week ."
"Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states ."
"The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks ."
"What kind of documents did you need to present ?"
"I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa ."
"Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ?"
"I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful ."
"Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ?"
"That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . "
"hello . How was the marketing meeting ?"
"hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted ."
"I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions ."
"so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people ."
"so what happened in the meeting ?"
"one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting ."
"I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections ."
"that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted ."
"may I make a suggestion ?"
"sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions ."
"Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide , I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea ."
"go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . "
"Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?"
"I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades ."
"What do you think is the biggest change ?"
"Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare ."
"That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more ."
"Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?"
"I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room ."
"That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough !"
"How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?"
"Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family ."
"I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?"
"They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . "
"How much is this shirt ?"
"80 yuan ."
"It's rather expensive , isn't it ?"
"It's a bit . But I can give you a discount ."
"How about 50 yuan ?"
"No . I'm afraid the price is too low ."
"Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ?"
"I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan ."
"All right . "
"Hi , how can I help ?"
"I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit ."
"Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice ."
"Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ?"
"Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity ."
"Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . "
"Hello . Beijing Restaurant . How can I help you ?"
"Hi . I want to place an order , please ."
"For pick - up or delivery ?"
"Pick - up ."
"What would you like to order ?"
"I have a menu from your restaurant . I ’ ll order using the number of each meal from your menu ."
"That ’ s fine ."
"I ’ d like to order number 17 , no . 23 and no . 24 ."
"What size ?"
"Medium , please ."

"I ’ ll be there in about an hour ."
"That will be fine . We ’ ll have your meals ready when you arrive . Thank you for your order . "
"May I help you ?"
"I have a problem ."
"What ’ s your problem ?"
"I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it ."
"I apologize for the inconvenience ."
"I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up ."
"I understand your problem ."
"Will you be able to solve my problem ?"
"I ’ m going to cancel the fees you owe ."
"So , I don ’ t have to pay any of it ?"
"The initial fee still must be paid ."
"That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much . "
"I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality ."
"I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality ."
"We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits ."
"Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want ."
"That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning ."
"Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . "
"That was really a nightmare !"
"Honey , what's up ?"
"I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator ."
"Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?"
"I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue ."
"Did you panic at the time ?"
"A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there ."
"Was there anyone else with you ?"
"Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying ."
"So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?"
"Yes . I have to call the property management ."
"For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?"
"Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building ."
"That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on ."
"I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . "
"There's a big problem with my room . I'm in 507 ."
"Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ?"
"I have cockroaches crawling in my room ."
"Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir ."
"I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see ."
"Sir , you haven't been drinking by any chance , have you ?"
"How dare you question my statement !"
"Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . "
"Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ?"
"I'm just comparing prices ."
"You should ! This thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here ."
"But they don't let you have goods on approval . "
"Hello , Mr . Compton ? This is Susan Miller ."
"Hi , Susan . What can I do for you ?"
"I ’ d like to take tomorrow off if that ’ s all right with you ."
"Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday . "
"Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks ."
"I know , but I am really sick ."
"Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here ."
"I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas "
"Hi . Can I help you , sir ?"

"Sure ."
"Thanks ."

"Is he doing very well at school ?"
"He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies ."
"What's his problem ?"
"This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem ."
"How can his he do that ?"
"There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . "
"Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals ."
"No , thank you , I am not interested ."
"Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you !"

"Has it been that long ?"
"How often do you go to the gym ?"
"I usually go every other day for about 3 hours ."
"That's a lot ."
"Yeah , I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and I saw no results . This is what you have to do to get noticeable results ."

"Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . "

"What about here in physical education ?"
"He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him ."
"So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! "
"Hi , Mark ! I was wondering if you finished that presentation you were working on last week ?"

"Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?"

"I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better ."
"Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . "
"How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ?"
"We try to recycle as much as we can ."
"What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ?"
"We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste ."
"But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ?"
"Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill "

"My computer isn't working ."
"Tell me what the problem is ."
"I'm trying to turn it on , but it won't work ."
"Try checking the connections ."
"Which ones are you referring to ?"
"The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet ."

"You should check the connections ."

"Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ?"
"Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now ."
"Wow . You look great ."
"Thanks for noticing ."
"What type of diet were you on ?"
"I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months ."
"That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?"
"Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day ."
"That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?"
"Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate ."
"That makes sense . I'm going to try that ."
"You don't need to lose weight ."
"I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of ."
"Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet ."
"Thanks for the advice ."
"No problem . "
"Well it ’ s my first night in Beijing . What should I eat ?"
"Well you have to try Peking duck ."
"Mm , I don ’ t really like duck to be honest with you . I fancy something light ."
"Ok , you could try the Peking wonton then ."
"That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ?"
"Actually , I know a great restaurant in Dongcheng ."
"Ok then , I ’ ll follow you . "
"Hello ! This is Air China Booking Office ."
"Hello ! I'd like to reconfirm my flight reservation ."
"May I know your flight number , please ?"
"It's flight CA169 , which leaves Beijing at 8: 00 a . m . on January 20th ."
"Oh , yes . That's our regular flight to Nanchang . Would you please tell me your name ?"
"My name is Deng Li ."
"Yes , here you are . You're flying in economy class . Is that right ?"
"Oh , no . I'm sure I made a reservation for a first-class ticket ."
"Let me check . Now , your ticket is in order . Thank you for calling to reconfirm ."
"That's what I should do . And I don't want to lose it ."
"Quite right . If you don't confirm , the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time . In order not to miss your flight , I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible ."
"OK ! I shall . "
"Hey ! Taxi ."
"Where are you heading , sir ?"
"Capital Airport ."
"What's your flight time ?"
"At 7:50 ."
"I guess we should get there no later than 7:00 ."
"How long is the ride from here then ?"
"Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ?"
"Yes , that'll be fine . How much is this going to cost ? "
"Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating ."
"So , what changed ?"
"Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer ."
"Wow , a real step up !"
"Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term ."
"I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ?"
"I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . "
"I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat ."
"Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?"
"Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries ."
"All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better !"
"What are you talking about ? I have salads some times ."
"Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy !"
"Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ?"
"It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! "
"Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment ."
"Is that difficult ?"
"Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you ."
"That's all right . What can I do ?"
"Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy ."
"Well . I can do it . And then ?"
"The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ?"
"Who will pay for these things ?"
"Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back ."
"OK . I will go in no time . "
"I'd like to apply for a personal loan ."
"How much would you like to borrow ?"
"A thousand dollars ."
"Let me check with our credit manager . ( later ) Our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . I don't think you'll have any problems ."
"What's the current interest rate ?"
"Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out this application form ? "
"Congratulations on the new house !"
"Thanks ! We love it ."
"Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful ."
"I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! "
"I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along ."
"That ’ ll be most helpful ."
"That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section ."
"How much do you spend on development every year ?"
"About 3-4 % of the gross sales ."
"What ’ s that building opposite us ?"
"That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock ."
"If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ?"
"It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . "
"Do you have some questions ?"
"Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company ."
"If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends ."
"I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year ."
"Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ?"
"No , thanks . "
"Come in , please ."
"Good morning , Mrs Smith ."
"Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please ."
"Yes , thank you ."
"I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ?"
"In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting ."
"Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ?"
"No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making ."
"From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience ."
"I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation ."
"You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English ."
"No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English ."
"That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ?"
"I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company ."
"Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ?"
"No , can you tell me about it ?"
"Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month ."
"I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ?"
"I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July ."
"Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you ."
"The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you ."
"Thank you . Good-bye . "
"You are from Japan , aren't you ?"
"Oh , yes !"
"I love Japan a lot ."
"I am glad to hear that ."
"Let's go to another place where my friend is working , let me pay here ."
"Thank you , I ’ ll pay next then ."
"Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you ."
"Check , please ."
"500 US dollars ."
"No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer ."
"You had champagne for the girl . "
"Have you watched today's news ?"
"No , I haven't . What's going on ?"
"Did you hear about last night's blackout ?"
"Yes . The lights were out all night ."
"Some people went looting because of the blackout ."
"What do you mean ?"
"People decided to use the blackout to their advantage ."
"People went out and looted ?"
"I guess they broke into about four stores ."
"Did the police find who did it ?"
"There's no evidence of who it was ."
"I hope we don't have any more blackouts . "
"I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here ."
"This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym ."
"Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ?"
"You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill ."
"All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ?"
"The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge ."
"Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ?"
"They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m ."
"seven days a week ."
"Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks !"
"The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there . "
"Do you know what time it is ?"
"Um . Ten ?"
"Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew ."
"I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party !"
"I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister !"
"Mom ! That is so unfair !"
"You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down !"
"What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding !"
"I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! "
"See how many people are here !"
"Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here !"
"Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company ."
"Can we just sit wherever we want ?"
"Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back ."
"Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ?"
"Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing !"
"Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps !"
"Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you ."
"I just hope he doesn't start bragging again !"
"I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus !"
"Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? "
"You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know ."
"Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too ."
"I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company ."
"Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ?"
"We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . "
"So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?"
"Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !"
"That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful ."
"What was so bad about it ?"
"Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work ."
"Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently ."
"Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . "
"John , do you have a minute ?"
"Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office ."
"But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work ."
"That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out ."
"Has anybody spoken to him about it ?"
"No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to ."
"We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ?"
"No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you ."
"How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ?"
"Oh , that would be too small ."
"With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks ."
"Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look ."
"Let's rock n ' roll . "
"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !"
"I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine ."
"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing ."
"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?"
"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick ."
"Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?"
"No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes ."
"You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . "
"What do you think are the qualities a nurse should have ?"
"They are responsibility , skill , patience , quietness , and so on ."
"What kind of medicines does the doctor usually prescribe to children who get high fever ?"
"Aspirin . "
"I ’ d like to check in please ."
"Certainly . Can I have the name please ?"
"Mr Harold Smith ."
"Ok , Are you checking out tomorrow ?"
"Yes , I am . That ’ s right ."
"Will you need a wake up call , sir ?"
"Yes please . At 6.30 am ."
"Ok then , your room is 502 on the fifth floor . Breakfast is served between 6.30 am and 9am . Enjoy your stay ."
"Thank you . "
"Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book !"
"You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent ."
"I do agree with you . "
"We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things ."
"Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office ."
"Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ?"
"We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit ."
"Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . "
"Waiter , can I have the bill please ?"
"Wait a moment . It's $ 30 ."
"We'd prefer separate checks ."
"OK , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 . "
"The dinner is really rich ."
"Which dish do you like most ?"
"I like the soy sauce chicken ."
"Actually , it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially . "
"John ? Can you come over here for a second ?"
"Certainly , Mr . Emory . What can I do for you ?"
"I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems ."
"Sure . Let me look over them and I ’ ll bring them back this afternoon . "
"Hello . This is the Customer service . How can I help you ?"
"Yes . I ’ Ve been getting harassing calls recently . Can I have my phone number changed ?"

"daisy ’ s in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood ."
"you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ?"
"he ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold ."
"he might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy ."
"I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow ."
"it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look ."
"oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling ."
"that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand ."
"yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . "
"I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please ."
"Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ?"
"How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ?"
"That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though ."
"Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty !"
"Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ?"
"Yes I do; here is my account number ."
"For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ?"
"3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please ."
"Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ? "
"How was your self-help trip ?"
"Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides ."
"Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones ?"
"I felt fine . I must have been too excited to notice ."
"I've never been to Disneyland . I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen . My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more . "
"Good morning , welcome aboard ."
"Good morning . Can I use my cellular phone during this time ?"
"Yes , you can use your cell phone during the boarding process until the aircraft door is closed ."
"Thank you . What should I do if I want to phone my family during the flight ?"
"The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones . They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft ."
"So I can use the onboard phone during the flight ?"
"Of course . They will be used at anytime before or during flight . "
"Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules ."
"Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things ."
"What are they ?"
"They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder ."

"Will you be voting this year ?"
"Of course ! Will you ?"
"This is going to be my first time voting ."
"Are you serious ?"
"I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing ."
"Voting is easy ."
"I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass ."
"The ballot gives you all that information ."
"Nobody told me that before ."
"You have nothing to worry about ."
"I ’ m so glad you told me that ."
"Good luck on your first election . "
"I'm going to quit this job . It's way too stressful ."
"I've noticed you've been working overtime a lot ."
"Yeah , I'm in the office till 10 every night . I can't take it anymore . The pay just isn't worth it . "
"Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ?"
"I want to save some US dollars into my account ."
"That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ?"
"Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for ."
"Well , we offer 5 grades as standard , Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ?"
"For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % ."
"That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . "
"Houston restaurant . Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"Yes . When do you start severing dinner ?"
"We open at 6:00 and take last orders at 10 :: 30 ."
"Well , that's fine . So I don't think it necessary for us to make a reservation . We will be there at 9:30 ."
"Yes , sir . We are looking forward to your coming . "
"Good afternoon , Ladies . May I help you ?"
"Can we have two a joining double room , sir ?"
"Have you made a reservation ladies ?"
"I ’ m afraid not ."
"One moment , please . I have to check if there are room available . I ’ m sorry ladies . We have only two double room available , but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?"
"We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night ."
"May I suggest family sweet ? You all just have a consolation ."
"what ’ s it like ?"
"It ’ s a big room with a king - size double bed and two single beds . You ’ Ve get also an roller-wheels ."
"That ’ s great . How much is it ?"
"2000 Hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax ."
"That ’ s fine ."
"But , ladies , the room ’ s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ’ ll let you know when the room ‘ s ready ."
"Alright . thanks ."
"Ladies , Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit ."
"Do you take traveller ’ s check ?"
"Yes , we do , Madam . Thank you , madam . Here ’ s our welcome brochure with all of information of our facilities . My name is John . If you need any help do let me know . I ’ m at your service . "
"How are your stocks doing , Jim ?"
"Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good ."
"Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too ."
"Just goes to show that you should buy companies , not ideas ."
"I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now ."
"Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Frank ?"
"No , what happened ?"
"He lost his kids ' college money day trading ."
"Oh , boy . His wife can ’ t be happy about that . "
"How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ?"
"That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins ."
"It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job ."
"OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second ."
"Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ?"
"We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st ."
"Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st ."
"Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments ."
"Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 ."
"I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything ."
"Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . "
"How can I help you ?"
"I'm here for a facial . I made an appointment over the phone for 3:30 today ."
"What's your name ?"
"Addison ."
"Ok . Which facial would you like ? We have five different kinds of facials ."
"Which would you recommend ?"
"Well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , I'd recommend our summer special . It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin ."
"What does it include ?"
"The facial will start with a thorough cleansing ."
"Does it include a facial mask and a massage ?"
"Yes . The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well ."
"Will you exfoliate the skin as well ?"
"Yes . We'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun ."
"That sounds great . I'll have that one then ."
"Ok , just follow me . "
"Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ?"
"Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen ."
"Well , what about price ?"
"The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . "
"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?"
"Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?"
"First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs ."
"How can you get that done ?"
"Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan ."
"What else ?"
"Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal ."
"Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?"
"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year ."
"Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first ."
"Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it ."
"OK , I'll take it . "
"You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?"
"In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go ."
"Like what ?"
"Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone ."
"You are not going to give it up , are you ?"
"No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either ."
"I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it ."
"Yes , but whom to ?"
"Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August ."
"That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees ."
"Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then ."
"Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . "
"I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ?"
"For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese ."
"I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders ."
"Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance ."
"Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable ."
"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China ."
"There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess ."
"You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ?"
"Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . "
"Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro ."
"Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?"
"It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month ."
"That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well ."
"That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . "
"Professor wang can I ask a few questions ?"
"Certainly ."
"What is the tariff ?"
"It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country ."
"Why does the government levy the tariff ?"
"Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue ."
"Anything else ."
"Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods ."
"Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang ."
"Do not mention it . "
"I want to make a reservation under the name of William Smith ."
"OK , Mr . Smith . When will you arrive ?"
"Around 12:00 ."
"Party of two ?"
"No , we have five persons ."
"All right , Mr . Smith . I will arrange a table for 5 at 12:00 for you ."
"Thank you . "
"Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday ."
"I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . "
"I'd like to cancel my reservation on flight MS701 to Warsaw on the 23rd.My name is Michael ."
"Hold on for a moment . ( a few minutes later ) I have cancelled your reservation.Shall I make another one for you ?"
"No , thanks ."
"I see . Please call us again for any further reservation.Thanks for calling us . "
"I really just have two problems with this ."
"Yes , sir ?"
"I ’ m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ’ re pretty new at all this ."
"I can understand that . Let me see if I can clarify some things for you . "
"Hi there , Philip . How ’ s everything going ?"
"It ’ s going pretty well , but I ’ m really tired !"
"I don ’ t blame you . You ’ Ve had a busy first week . Take a rest !"
"It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy ! "
"Ms . Montgomery ? Do you have a moment ?"
"Sure , Brian . What ’ s on your mind ?"
"I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ?"
"No , not at all , Brian . This year , we ’ Ve all had to cut back . I ’ m hoping next year ’ s going to better . I hope you can understand . "
"Show me your passport , please ."
"Here you are ."
"How long are you staying in Britain ?"
"3 weeks . I am here on tour ."
"Have a pleasant stay in Britain . "
"Excuse me , can you tell me how to apply for a visa to America ?"
"Log on to the website of American Embassy in Beijing and fill in the application forms ."
"And what should I do next ?"
"Then make an appointment by telephone and wait for the interview ."
"How long will I wait for ?"
"It all depends ."
"What's the fee for application ?"
"About 800 yuan ."
"Thank you very much ."
"You are welcome . "
"Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ?"
"Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it ."
"What kind of information would you like ?"
"Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available ."
"Yes , it's still open ."
"Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ?"
"Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ?"
"Thank you very much . Bye-bye . "
"Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ?"
"Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ?"
"That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ?"
"Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck ."
"It sounds good ."
"Yes , it is the best of our hotel ."
"Really ? Let me have a try ."
"Thank you . Just a moment , please . "
"No-no-no , sorry ! That's a handicapped parking space . Are you handicapped ?"
"No , but this is an emergency ! Please !"
"Sorry , but you'll have to park in a normal space ."
"OK , OK , fine ! Just open the gate !"
"Be patient , miss . It'll just be a second ."
"Thank god ! A car's leaving . It's my turn ! "
"Good morning . Please come into my office ."
"Good morning . Thank you ."
"I see that you have some impressive writing experience ."
"Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel ."
"Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper . "
"I haven ’ t seen you in a while . How have you been ?"
"Things are going fairly well . How about you ?"
"Well , I ’ m hanging in there , but I lost my job and need to find another one quickly ."
"I am looking for a job myself . What were you thinking of doing next ?"
"I am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by ."
"Have you gotten any interviews yet ?"
"No , I haven ’ t been out on one interview yet ."
"Have you thought about the electrician program over there ?"
"I think that I might be interested in that position ."
"I think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program . "
"There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime ."
"I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance ."
"We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . "
"Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ?"
"Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?"
"Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university ."

"No , who won ?"
"Our new President is John McCain ."
"What ? You can ’ t be serious !"
"I was just as shocked when I found out ."
"Why would anyone vote for McCain ?"
"The people have spoken ."
"That ’ s horrible ."
"If you don ’ t like that , then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what I tell you next ."
"More bad news ?"
"I was just joking , and Obama is our new President ."
"Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news . "

"My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds ."
"Oh , really ?"
"The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too ."
"Well , it's a good thing for you ."
"Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has ."
"So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?"
"I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food ."
"junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat ."
"But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous ."
"Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it ."

"They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks ."
"Are they breakable ?"
"No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful ."
"No wonder it's so expensive . "
"Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ?"
"I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way ."
"You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar ."
"Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you ."
"I understand ."
"Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ?"
"I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 ."
"All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ?"
"Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement ."
"Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ?"
"Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you ."
"Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . "
"Please take a seat ."
"Thanks ."
"Now what can I do for you ?"
"Well , I'm looking for a job ."
"Fine , but first I need some information about you ."

"Thank you ."
"Can I get you something , coffee , tea ?"
"No , I'm fine . Thank you . "
"Would you like to order now ?"
"This all looks good ! I think we know what we want ."
"Please let me point out the chef's special , which is blackened catfish ."
"I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ?"
"We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs ."
"Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ?"
"The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice ."
"I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce . I would like the garlic sauce on the side ."
"Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree , or would you like it served now ?"
"You can serve our salads with our dinner . "
"Welcome , sir . May I help you ?"

"Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ?"
"Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both ."
"Great . So how long is the trip ?"
"15 days . The transportation by air will take five days ."
"Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ?"
"Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge , Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ?"
"Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything ."
"Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it ."
"Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week ."
"Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... , Yes , sir . It will be a great pity !"
"Well . Ok , I will take it ."
"Thank you ! "
"Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend ."
"Yes ."
"My advice would be to finish it at once . "
"Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore ."
"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas ."
"Show me some classic high heels , please ."
"Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?"
"Black . Classic ."
"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone ."
"Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe ."
"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable ."
"I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for ."
"What size ?"
"Seven-and-a-half ."
"Here we are . How does it fit ?"
"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time ."
"Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . "
"Shall we share a taxi ?"
"Where are you heading now ?"
"I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house ."
"Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?"
"That's the one ."
"You mean we'll share the taxi ?"
"Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully ."
"Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . "
"Hello . May I help you ?"
"Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ?"
"Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ?"
"What ’ s this form for ?"
"This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you ."
"That's great . But how long do I have to wait ?"
"Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell ."
"Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ?"
"Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there ."
"Then , what do you think I should do ?"
"My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too ."
"I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye ."
"Keep in touch . "
"All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon ."
"Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision ."
"That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday ."
"Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . "
"Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... , Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets ."
"Blow my nose ?"
"Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster ."
"No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !"
"It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it ! "
"Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ?"
"I don't think we can ."
"Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ?"
"By the middle of October , I think ."
"That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated ."
"I understand ."
"Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season ."
"But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter ."
"Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out ."
"I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery ."
"That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration ."
"You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands ."
"But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us ."
"All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . "
"Good morning , sir . How may I help you ?"
"I'd like to open an account ."
"Certainly , sir . Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account ?"
"Actually , I'd like to open one of each , if that's possible ."
"No problem , sir . What sort of time deposit account would you like to open ?"
"What are my choices ?"
"The minimum time period is three months . The longer the period , the higher the interest rate . If you withdraw your money before time is up , there are penalties . "
"Fancy seeing you here 。 Lily ."
"Yeah.What a surprise !"
"How's everything going ?"
"Fine.thanks . "
"Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ?"
"I usually go to the supermarket , near the station ."
"How do you find the prices there ?"
"I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh ."
"I see you have bought some coffee.Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?"
"Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . "
"Hey honey , how was your day ?"
"It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam ."
"Why ? What happened ?"
"Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s ."
"Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older ."
"Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too ."
"Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money ."
"Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine ."
"I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare ."
"Not in a million years ! "
"Repair service , how may I help you ?"
"My phone has got lot of static ."
"How old is your phone ?"
"About five years old ."
"The wire in your phone might have gotten rusty . Could you bring your phone into our office ? We'll clean it for you ."
"Sure , where is your office ?"
"We're located at 132 West Street ."
"When are you available ?"
"From 9A . M . to 5 P . M ."
"Alright , I'll bring it in this afternoon ."
"No problem . See you this afternoon . "
"Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me ."
"Yes , this is a very popular car ."
"I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ?"
"The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price ."
"You can tell me here . I just want to know the price ."
"50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee ."
"I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit ."
"Then what price would be fair to you ?"
"I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car ."
"I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price ."
"Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car ."
"38000yuan is my final offer ."
"Hum ... OK . I will take it . "
"O . K . So , where do you think we can save more money ?"
"Well , we could eat in more . That $ 300 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants ."
"Yeah , that ’ s a good idea , and you like to cook . What about the books ?"
"No , I need my books ."
"Come on , if we save more money we can retire earlier , and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy ."
"Well , what about the $ 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could ’ Ve gotten something for less ."
"O . K . Let ’ s compromise , if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books , I ’ ll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt ."
"All right . That sounds fair . "
"morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week ."
"Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week ."
"Fine , Mr . Emory . Would next Monday at 4:00 o ’ clock be all right for you ?"
"Let me take a look . All right , that ’ s no problem . See you then . "
"What's today's special ?"
"I think our smoked fish will be to your taste ."
"OK , I'd like to try it today . "
"Benter's Books ."
"Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries ."
"We have several hundred in stock ."
"Is there a discount for buying in large quantity ? "
"Kids are always difficult to control ."
"True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away ."
"Kids are kids . "
"Would you care for a cup of tea before your meal ?"
"OK , thank you ."
"How about some Oolong tea ? It's very popular with our guests ."
"That'd be nice . "
"Here is the document you asked for this morning ."
"Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks ."
"You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later ."
"This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?"
"The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place ."
"Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . "
"I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails ."
"So you have to open all the envelopes ."
"Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly ."
"Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?"
"Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . "
"Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ?"
"It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now ."
"Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?"
"News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on ."
"Is there anything interesting ?"
"Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education ."
"I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?"
"Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs ."
"That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?"
"Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals ."
"I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?"
"Yes , 50 Yuan per month ."
"It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it ."
"Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving ."
"It can also entertain your passengers like me ."
"That's the point . "
"Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look ."
"What is it ?"
"It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you ."
"Let ’ s see ... “ Wanted , Come on , what have you got to lose ?"
"What about my resume ?"
"Here , I ’ ll help you type one up ."
"Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I ’ ll call now to set up an interview . "
"Have you made up your mind ?"
"Not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ?"
"We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops ."
"Please bring me the chicken chops . "
"Good afternoon . Welcome to China . May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ?"
"Yes , here you are ."
"Thank you . What's your occupation , Mr . Smith ?"
"I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation ."
"You are here on business , aren't you ?"
"Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks ."
"I see . Do you have anything to declare ?"
"Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare ."
"Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in ."
"All right . "
"Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ?"
"Yeah.There ' s an express that leaves in twenty minutes ."
"May I buy a ticket here at the station ?"
"Sure ."
"Where ?"
"Go to window number eleven ."
"Thanks . "
"I think my car can run much faster than yours ."
"But mine equals yours in economy ."
"That's true . "
"Hi , I'm checking in . The last name is Rama ."
"Yes , here is your reservation . You have a standard room reserved for two nights . Is that right ?"
"Actually , no . It should be a suite . I had booked a non-smoking king ."
"Oh , my mistake . The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed . I'm sorry for the error ."
"That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ?"
"Sure , that's no problem . May I have your credit card ? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals ."
"Here it is ."
"Okay , now if you could please verify the room rate here , initial next to the X , and sign right here . How many keys will you need ?"
"Oh , just one ."
"Okay , you're all set . You're in room 1201 . Take the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left . Do you need any help with your bags ?"
"No , I'm fine . Thanks ."
"Enjoy your stay . "
"Why do you want to work in our company ?"
"Well , there are 2 reasons . First of all , I'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise . Secondly , your branch is a new establishment in Beijing . I think I'll be assigned more workload and responsibilities here ."
"Can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?"
"Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . "
"Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry ."
"Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview ."
"Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once ."
"OK , thank you , I'll try if there were other chances . "
"Good afternoon . Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position ."
"Hello , have a seat . I ’ m Bill Gotcha . I am assuming you found your way here with no trouble ?"
"Actually , I am very familiar with the area so there was absolutely no problem ."
"I am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer ."
"I am interested in switching fields ."
"Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular ."
"I am good at pulling together teams of people to accomplish a task ."
"What are you not good at ?"
"I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself ."
"We appreciate hearing that about you ! "
"Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"Yes , we would like to take a tour to L . A ."
"Well , that's really a big city . How long do your vacations last ?"
"2 weeks . Can I have a brochure of the sightseeing tours ?"
"Here you are . Take your time . "
"Excuse me , Miss . The total works wrong . What are these extra charges ?"
"There's a 20 percent service charge in this hotel ."
"Well . What's this 138 dollars charge then ?"
"That's for the hotel restaurant . You had five meals here ."
"Oh , right . I forgot about that . Sorry , I'll pay cash . "
"Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ?"
"I want to book a tour with adventure sports ."
"Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you , I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ?"
"Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying ."
"What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next !"
"Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge ."
"I ’ m thinking something exciting but safer ."
"I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey !"
"That ’ s more like it ! "
"Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ?"
"You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive !"
"I bought it on eBay . It was only one-tenth of the original price . And the purchase was so easy ."
"No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ?"
"Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky ."
"A risk I would never take ... , Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up ! "
"Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ?"
"Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with ."
"So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ?"
"Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night ."
"I thought homecoming was a high school dance ."
"It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too . "
"You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ?"
"Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning ."
"But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ?"
"It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them ."
"That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later ."
"Working at weekend is something I hate to do most ."
"But if the company asks , what else can we do ? "
"Are there any special unemployment forms I need to fill out ?"
"You need to get a special application form ."
"Do you know where I can find the application form ?"
"You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up ."
"What records will I have to show to apply for unemployment benefits ?"
"They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them ."
"Is there anything else I will need to provide ?"
"Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof ."
"Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ?"
"You will receive a notice for a phone interview , which will continue the process . "
"I'd like to try the chef's special ."
"Then what about you , Miss ?"
"I am on a diet . Do you have a vegetarian menu ?"
"The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu ."
"Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding . "
"What is my ideal weight ?"
"It depends on your height and body type ."
"How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ?"
"By warming up before and cooling down after your workout ."
"Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up ."
"Well , it's completely changed my life ."
"Tell us how ."
"Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach ."
"And now ?"
"Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle ."
"Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . "
"Hey , Benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ?"
"Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days ."
"What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous ."
"Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports ."
"Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic ."
"So what items must be involved in this report ?"
"First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year ."
"Yeah , is that all ?"
"Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events ."
"That's too complicated ."
"And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report ."
"Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ?"
"I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports ."
"But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ?"
"OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . "
"Excuse me , do you sell apples ?"
"Yes . They are over there ."
"Do you sell them individually or by weight ?"
"By weight . 6.0 cents per pound ."
"Could you weigh these , please ?"
"$ 4.55 , please . Anything else ?"
"A sack of cherries , please ."
"Here you are . "
"Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ?"
"Yes , I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license ."
"How many years have you had the driver's license ?"
"I have two years driving experience ."
"That's good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ?"
"I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel ."
"What computer languages have you learned ?"
"Visual C + + , C and Delphi ."
"Have you gotten any special training in programming ?"
"No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . "
"Hello , Peace Hotel ."
"Hello , I'm calling from Beijing . I'd like to reserve a double room with a bath from tonight on for five days , please ."
"A moment , please . I'll check our room availability for these days ... Yes , that's all right.What ' s your name please ?"
"John Smith . J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H . "
"What's your apartment like ?"
"It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus ."
"What is it like living in on-campus housing ?"
"It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it ."
"Did you have to pay a deposit ?"
"No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month ."
"Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?"
"No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here ."
"How long is your contract for ?"
"That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon ."
"Have you started looking yet ?"
"Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer ."
"Good luck ! "
"Which service offered by your bank do you use most ?"
"I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see ."
"Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around ."
"I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash ."
"Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit ."
"Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines ."
"That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too ."
"Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others ."
"I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher ."
"I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use ."
"That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . "
"Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ?"
"Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ?"
"Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for ."
"I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan ."
"One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too ."
"So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ?"
"That is correct ."
"I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . "
"I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ?"
"We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ?"
"No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too ."
"Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer ."
"Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue ."
"I'll see you later then ."
"Bye ! I'll be back before seven . "
"Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ?"
"I'd like to withdraw 35,000 RIB from my Corporate Account ."
"Do you have an appointment ?"
"Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E ."
"Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ?"
"Here you go ."
"I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here ."
"Oh , how silly of me . Can we correct it here ?"
"I'm sorry , we cannot make corrections on these . You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount , I'm afraid . "
"Good afternoon . How can I help you ?"
"Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM ."
"Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door ."
"Done . Here is my paper ."
"Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager ."
"What about the 3rd round ?"
"Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . "
"How do I get to the EDD ?"
"Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet ."
"Can I go in to look for a job at their office ?"
"That ’ s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there ."
"Is there an office near me ?"
"The Internet has a list of Employment Development Offices listed online ."
"Do you know where the local office for this area is ?"
"Our office is over on Green Street , just west of the college ."
"If I go there , will I be able to collect money right away ?"
"Everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect . "
"How much are you asking for this ?"
"I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ?"
"Is tax already included in their price ?"
"Yes . Our price can't be matched ."
"Would you consider a volume discount ?"
"If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount ."
"I'll accept your offer . "
"Francis , what ’ s that ?"
"Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure ."
"Could you tell me something about it ?"
"Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company ."
"How many departments do we have ?"
"Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch ."
"Ok . Who should I report to ?"
"Mr . White , too . "
"Waiter , a table for two , please ."
"Yes , this way please ."
"Can we see the menu please ."
"Here you are ."
"What ’ s good today ?"
"I recommend crisp beef and fried duck ."
"We don ’ t want that . Well . perhaps will be begin with mushroom soap and follow by some seafood and chips ."
"Do you want any dissert ?"
"no dissert , thanks , just coffee.can I have the check please ? "
"Miss , where do you want to go ?"
"Could you drop me off at the airport ?"
"No problem ."
"Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ?"
"Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece ."
"All right . "
"We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ?"
"Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing ."
"Oh , that's good ."
"We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products ."
"It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . "
"They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears ."
"I'm very touched , and I can't help bursting into tears at the wedding ."
"Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's ."
"Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride ."
"You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ?"
"Judy , Why are you so interested in her ?"
"Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman , He's terribly handsome ."
"I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive ."
"Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you ."
"Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . "
"I came in to see how my home inspection went ."
"First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ?"
"I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it ."
"I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it ."
"The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month ."
"Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken ."
"Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ?"
"The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced ."
"Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?"
"The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . "
"Welcome to our company ."
"I really love this kind of atmosphere ."
"An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company ."
"There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ?"
"She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network ."
"And what about that man there ?"
"He is our accountant ."
"I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees ."
"Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . "
"What channel did you watch last night ?"
"Channel Two . A TV series was showing on it . The name of the series is Huanzhu Gene , How do you feel about it ?"
"Generally it's to my appetite . What about you ?"
"Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time , Don't be too critical . So what's your favorite ?"
"Variety shows and talk shows , I think . "
"We need to know whether you have the special training ."
"Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college ."
"How about your experience ?"
"I worked as a PR clerk for one year "
"Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ?"
"Yes , I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education ."
"Yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses ."
"That's very generous ."
"I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days ."
"Thank you . I appreciate the time you've given to me . "
"How does the political system work in your country ?"
"We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s ."
"Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?"
"Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members ."
"What ’ s a cabinet ?"
"This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy ."
"Can any mp make a law ?"
"Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law ."
"I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties ."
"Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to ."
"How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?"
"They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters . "
"Excuse me . I want to pay the bill ."
"Please wait till your name is called ."
"OK.Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan ."
"Here you are ."
"Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ?"
"No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance ."
"In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . "
"So , John , what do you do for a living ?"
"I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company ."
"Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?"
"Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that ."
"Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ?"
"About two years now . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I need some stamps ."
"What kind of stamps do you want ?"
"How much do I need for this letter ?"
"I must weigh it ."
"How much ? Is it overweight ?"
"It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?"
"How much is it , then ?"
"Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all ."
"OK . Here you are . "
"do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?"
"not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?"
"sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?"
"have you heard of Hot Fuzz ?"
"yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ?"
"that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?"
"to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best ."
"what do you have in mind ?"
"I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster ."
"isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ?"
"yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?"
"not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ?"
"It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ?"
"Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen ."
"that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?"
"it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time ."
"great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ?"
"sounds good . I'll see you then ! "
"To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ?"
"First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here ."
"Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved ."
"Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ?"
"Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ?"
"Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ?"
"Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off ."
"That's exactly my understanding ."
"Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I am coming to inquire about the information of the company . When was this company established ?"
"Well , this company can be dated back to 1893 , so it has a hundred years of history ."
"Really ? That is amazing . "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes . I am going to have a summer vacation . Would you recommend some scenic spots to see ?"
"Which place are you most interested in ?"
"Maybe Europe ."
"Well , I strongly suggest you going to London . It's really charming ."
"Let me have a look at the pamphlet . "
"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?"
"Hi , Rita , I ’ m just looking for a pair of shoes . I won ’ t be here for long ."
"Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices ."
"That ’ s my problem . I don ’ t have a lot of options ."
"So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?"
"Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection ."
"Well , you ’ re in the right store . If they don ’ t have it , no one will ."
"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . "
"Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ?"
"Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this ."
"Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ?"
"Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with ."
"What would you say is your most positive quality ?"
"Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . "
"Do I have to talk to the interviewer or just leave my application ?"
"You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater ."
"What should I do in the fair ?"
"You should take a look at all the companies , choose your favorite ones , go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end . "
"Do you have the letter of approval of employment ?"
"No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet ."
"In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition ."
"Ok , I see . "
"Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue ."
"It is true . I think we should change some policies ."
"Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts ."
"Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing ."
"Like you and me ! "
"I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together ."
"It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ?"
"I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements ."
"Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ?"
"I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price ."
"Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation ."
"What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice ."
"As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it ."
"You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help ."
"We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . "
"What time is our connecting flight ?"
"Let me check . Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 ."
"Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?"
"It's at ... gate 14 ."
"Oh , great ! That's at the other end of the terminal !"
"OK , so here's the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !"
"I'm be right behind ya ! "
"Hi , this is ABC Company . Is that Joseph ?"
"Yes , speaking . Anything I can do for you ?"
"I am calling to tell you that the interview for you is in our company on Monday morning at 8: 00 ."
"Where is the interview happening ?"
"It is on the Jianshe Street where there is a Carrefour Supermarket near it . "
"What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ?"
"I think we can have a try ."
"Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style ."
"I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ?"
"I think it is ."
"Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ?"
"I prefer the linen one . "
"I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia ."
"Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ?"
"Sure . It ’ s not very heavy ."
"That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it ."
"I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail ."
"That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars ."
"How long will it take to get there ?"
"Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks ."
"It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel ."
"No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra ."
"Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars ."
"There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye . "
"Do you have any luggage ?"
"Yes , a suitcase and carry-on ."
"Here's your boarding pass . Have a nice flight ."
"Thank you . "
"How many hours do you work a week ?"
"I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4 , And how many weeks holiday do you get a year ?"
"Four - plus public holidays . I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year ."
"Do you do overtime ?"
"Yes , if we're busy . I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends . "
"Beauties Picture , how may I help you ?"
"I need to speak with David Lin ."
"He's out of his office ."
"Thank you , I'll try again later . "
"Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied ."
"Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ?"
"I'm afraid ... , All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . "
"How's everything , Janice ?"
"I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call ."
"Which company ?"
"Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ?"
"Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... , But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties ."
"YOU GET ME !"
"All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave ."
"Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow ."
"It's all or nothing . "
"It is really exciting news ."
"What news ?"
"You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones ."
"You know what we will get ?"
"We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station ."
"What docking station ?"
"This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient ."
"Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . "
"We have a great variety of men's suits , sir.Which particular brand do you prefer ?"
"Pierre Cardin ."
"How about this one ?"
"It look fine.Can I try it on ? "
"Have you had any publications ?"
"Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist ."
"How about your communication skills ?"
"As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like this shirt to be dry-cleaned ."
"Sure . When do you want to get it back ?"
"I have to wear it this afternoon . Do you have a urgent service ?"
"Yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours ."
"OK . How much should I pay ?"
"30 yuan . "
"Joy Chain elementary school , please ."
"Will do ."
"How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming ."
"Ma'am , take your kid to school ?"
"Yes . I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut ."
"No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus ."
"The traffic is terrible on Monday morning . It takes us almost 1 hour to get to school ."
"My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way ."
"That's wonderful . He is killing two birds with one stone.Sir , please turn right at the next corner . And stop at the taxi stand ."
"OK !"
"What is the fare ?"
"It's 14.5 Yuan ."
"Keep the change !"
"Thanks , Ma'am . "
"That is the most boring , typical gift in the world !"
"I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one ."
"That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain ."
"It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie !"
"The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... , But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside ."
"A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! "
"May I help you ?"
"Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English ."
"I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ?"
"My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ?"
"I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please ."
"Thank you , Miss Kelly ."
"What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?"
"I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute ."
"Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?"
"Yes , I would ."
"Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ?"
"Yes , I'd like to give it a try ."
"All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . "
"Do you have cheongsams ?"
"Yes.We have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.What do you think of this one ?"
"The styte is OK . Which country is this made in ?"
"It's made in China . The quality is excellent ."
"Please wrap it . "
"What is this eviction notice for ?"
"The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate ."
"Are you kidding me ?"
"I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business ."
"You can ’ t just throw me out on the street !"
"You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you ."
"Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ?"
"You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments ."
"I am going to take care of the rent payment right now ."
"Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check . "
"How about the working hours ?"
"From 9 to 12 a . m ."
"and 2 to 6 p . m ."
"Can I ask for a leave ?"
"Of course , if necessary ."
"Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ?"
"Seldom ."
"That's OK . How can my salary be improved ?"
"Your quantity sold is beyond the required by more than 30 % . "
"Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it ."
"Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? "
"Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ?"
"I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant ."
"There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper ."
"OK , we could look at that ."
"Do you have a particular type of food that you would like ?"
"I really like Japanese or Thai food ."
"That Japanese restaurant , Shogun , got good reviews ."
"Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it !"
"Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday ?"
"That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ? "
"Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ?"
"That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner ."
"That's the reason why you fought ?"
"Yes ."
"You two are always quarrelling over little things ."
"That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode !"
"Are you still mad at her now ?"
"To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done ."
"Will you apologize to her ?"
"No way . It ’ s her who should apologize . "
"What does Human Resources Department do ?"
"Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation ."
"They take care of a lot of things ."
"But most of time , they provide assistances ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates ."
"Yes ?"
"The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits ."
"OK ."
"Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate ."
"I see . "
"Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ?"
"In April or early May ."
"I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing ."
"In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited ."
"You understand a timely delivery is very important to us ."
"All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . "
"There ’ re traffic jams everywhere ."
"I think something must be done ."
"Yeah . We should have more roads built ."
"I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . "
"Excuse me , Mr . Emory ?"
"Yes , Christine ?"
"Could you tell me where the copier is , please ?"
"Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . "
"Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !"
"What happened ?"
"I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career !"
"Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ?"
"Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world ."
"Uh-huh ."
"But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? "
"How was your morning jog ?"
"Very good . I feel quite refreshed now ! You should come with me sometime - exercise is good for you !"
"To be honest , I ’ d rather watch television ! Where did you go ?"
"I just ran alongside the main road ."
"Oh you ought to go to the park next time . They have a route for joggers there ."
"Oh ok , I ’ ll try that tomorrow . It ’ ll probably be better than fighting with the traffic ! Go on , why don ’ t you come along ?"
"Oh ok then , I ’ ll come and watch you ! "
"May I help you at all ?"
"Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ?"
"We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country ."
"I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible ."
"This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items ."
"So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ?"
"That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see ."
"That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . "
"How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ?"
"One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind ."
"But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard ."
"We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made ."
"Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ?"
"Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . "
"You are from the travel agency , aren't you ?"
"Yes , are you Mr James ?"
"Yes , I am . Are you Miss Li from the travel agency ?"
"That's right ."
"Do you mind telling me your name ?"
"Of course not . My name is Li Ping . Is this all your baggage ?"
"Yes , it is . I usually travel light ."
"Welcome to Hong Kong . I'll go and get the car . Could you please wait a few minutes ?"
"Sure , and I'm glad to meet you . Thanks for your help . "
"Fill it up , please ."
"Fine . Do you want your windshield cleaned ?"
"No , thank you . I don't have time . How much is that ?"
"It comes to $ 15 . "
"Did you call me , sir ?"
"Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ?"
"What am I expected to do ?"
"As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department ."
"I see . It must be a challenging job , but I would like to do it . And what about now ?"
"For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly ."
"OK , I'll get to work on it at once . "
"Taxi !"
"Where to ?"
"Beijing International Airport . Would you please help me with my baggage ?"
"Certainly . Let's put the suitcase in the boot ."
"Thank you . I've got just 50 minutes to go . Can we manage ?"
"Take it easy . We should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam ."
"I can't afford to miss my 9:40 flight ."
"Don't worry . The traffic is smooth . You will be there in time for your flight . "
"Sir , how can I help you ?"
"I'd like a one-inch photo for my interview ."
"OK , please take a seat . Look at here . Head up . Done ."
"I want to fetch them in 3 days . "
"Do you like traveling by train or by plane ?"
"I think I prefer train . It's cheaper and safe . "
"Are you a social person ?"
"Yes , I am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends ."
"What is your strategy in communicating with colleagues ?"
"Well , the most important thing in communication is your sincerity . "
"Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce !"
"Are you trying to lose weight ?"
"Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles ."
"You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong ."
"Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?"
"Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors ."
"So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?"
"Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish ."
"If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?"
"Don ’ t count on it . "
"Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare ."
"Employee welfare ? What all does that include ?"
"In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations ."
"What kind of considerations are we talking about ?"
"It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman ."
"Our company now has n ombudsman ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . "
"I have finished filling in the forms . Can I go to my room now ?"
"Yes , here's your key . The bellboy will take you to your room ."
"Thank you . "
"Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection ."
"There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download ."
"I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit ."
"Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net ."
"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?"
"Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone ."
"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things ."
"That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number ."
"That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time , How do I do that ?"
"Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will , That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . "
"Three twenty-five cent stamps , please ."
"Here you are . seventy-five cent , please ."
"And please sent this letter by registered mail ."
"Is there anything valuable in it ?"
"There ’ s a check of two hundred dollars and photograph ."
"Shall I make out a receipt ?"
"No . don ’ t bother ."
"That ‘ ll be ninety-five cents in all . "
"Which route are you interested in ?"
"I think the four days ' tour from New York to Atlantic City will be fine ."
"That's a good choice ."
"What is the departure date ?"
"We have parties every Saturday from June to October . "
"Good morning , may I help you ?"
"Good morning . I want to remit 1,000 yuan to my sister in Shanghai ."
"Please fill out this form ."
"OK ... Do I need to put on my sister's name for the receiver ?"
"Yes . You must put on her name and address ."
"OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ?"
"Let me check . Yes . Your 1,000 remittance , please ."
"Here you are . What is the rate ?"
"This rate is one percent . That will be 10 yuan ."
"OK . When will this remittance arrive ?"
"Generally it will arrive within three days ."
"That's good . "
"What is your great struck ?"
"I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time ."
"Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ?"
"Because I ’ m very competent in this area ."
"Are you working under pressure ?"
"Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines ."
"Are you more a follower or a leader ?"
"I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . "
"What's your products ' competitive edge ?"
"You have probably noticed that our products ' prices are competitive . Besides . we can provide more superior products than other companies at the same price ."
"We need your detail explanation ."
"It means that if you place a big order , we usually allow 15 % for a trade discount . And our products feel more slip , colorful and faddish than others . You can have a look ."
"It sounds good , and how about its quality ? We only look for the best ."
"We always sell the best . You can believe us at this point ."
"OK ! How long dose it take you to deliver if we order 1000 pieces of silk ?"
"Within 2 weeks once we receive your orders . "
"What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ?"
"All staff can enjoy the health insurance program ."
"What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ?"
"Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance . "
"What position have you held before ?"
"I have been a salesman ."
"Would you tell me the general description of your present job ?"
"I am in charge of the trading department ."
"What made you decide to change your job ?"
"I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible ."
"Why do you leave your present company ?"
"I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work ."
"Why did you pick this organization ?"
"I'm very much interested in the position ."
"What made you decide to join our company ?"
"I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . "
"So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ?"
"It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try ."
"That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish ."
"Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten ."
"I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ?"
"There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it ."
"Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food ."
"Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice ."
"What about veggies ?"
"They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal ."
"It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! "
"We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this ."
"OK . Let me send a memo around ."
"Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back ."
"I don ’ t think he ’ s back today ."
"Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !"
"I know , it ’ s a big one . "
"Shall we start decorating the bedroom ?"
"I've already started ."
"When ?"
"This afternoon . "
"Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 ."
"I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 ."
"So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you ."
"Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ?"
"Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us ."
"So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 ."
"And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 ."
"And is that all ?"
"Yes , this is everything on the list ."
"So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ?"
"Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ?"
"I think £ 5 would be good . "
"Where did you study accounting ?"
"I studied at Anshan University ."
"Did you intern anywhere ?"
"Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season ."
"That must have been stressful ."
"Yes , but I learned a lot ."
"I'll bet ."
"I learned about different tax laws and how they work . "
"Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview ."
"That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it ."
"I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ?"
"It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet ."
"Good idea . It is convenient and fast ."
"You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely ."
"Certainly ."
"I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it ."
"I think that about one hundred words are enough ."
"After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply ."
"OK , I know now . "
"Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ?"
"I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ?"
"Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right ."
"Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? "
"Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !"
"Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ?"
"Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you ."
"Sure . Meet me at five . "
"The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down ."
"What ’ s up ?"
"Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday ."
"Anything that distracts you from work ?"
"Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things ."
"Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ?"
"Well , I will try . "
"Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ?"
"I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees ."
"That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ?"
"Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls ."
"That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday ."
"It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark ."
"Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home ! "
"These two sections need to be re-written , Jerry . The last guy that did this really mixed things up ."
"Yeah , I could tell that . That ’ s no problem . I can probably get it re-done by tomorrow . When ’ s our meeting with the boss ?"
"Not until next week , I think , the 15th ."
"Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time . "
"Flight BE 407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge ?"
"Oh , how annoying !"
"The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible ."
"Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . "
"Which department do you want to register with ?"
"I want to see a dentist ."
"Please pay the registration fee , 10 Yuan ."
"OK , thank you . "
"Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?"
"Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket ."
"Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories ."
"I like this jacket . Can I try it on ?"
"Of course . The changing rooms are over there ."
"Thanks . "
"can I see these silk ties ?"
"No problem ."
"I ’ ll take this one ."
"Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ?"
"No , thank you . I want to have a look at that scarf ."
"Ok . We have several kinds of scarves here . Let me get them for you . Just wait a minute ."
"Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it . "
"This is the rush hour ."
"I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away ."
"Let ’ s drive off this road ."
"I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . "
"So , are we all ready to go ?"
"Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed , we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car ."
"Did you get the camera ?"
"Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ?"
"Yup , it ’ s all set ."
"You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ?"
"I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered ."
"Well , let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips !"
"Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ?"
"But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes ."
"I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . "
"We are sorry for our fault ."
"I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business ."
"Thank you for your understanding . "
"Is there a vacant table for 2 right now ?"
"I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked ."
"what a pity ."
"Would you mind waiting in the lounge for 10 minutes ? I am sure I can arrange you a table then ."
"OK . "
"Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ?"
"I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please ."
"Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ?"
"That might be a good idea , yes ."
"Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ?"
"I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks ."
"Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ?"
"No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . "
"Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot ."
"Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ?"
"No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it ."
"I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away ."
"It's no big deal . Thank you . "
"What's your favorite magazine ?"
"Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite ."
"What kind of magazine is it ?"
"It's instructive and inspiring ."
"Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ?"
"No , it's a semimonthly ."
"Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?"
"Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores ."
"Oh , I think I should try to read one . "
"Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?"
"Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe ."
"What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing ."
"Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion ."
"What am I going to do ?"
"Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . "
"So your mom can stop nagging you now ."
"Trust me . She'll keep nagging . She thinks something will go wrong ."
"Don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again ."
"You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck ."
"The day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day ."
"My mom just wants everything to be perfect for us . "
"How's your job search going ?"
"I only started looking for a job a few days ago ."
"have you finished compiling your resume ?"
"yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ?"
"that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content ."
"absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read ."
"good . How about your cover letter ?"
"a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ?"
"no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of , sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention ."
"yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview ."
"got it . I'll start right now . "
"I've been told you might have a vacant room ."

"This apartment looks nice ."
"Yes , it has two bedrooms . That's convenient ."
"How much is the rents ?"
"2,500 yuan a month ."
"This apartment is nice , but I'd like to find a cheaper one . "
"Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis ."
"Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ?"
"Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ?"
"No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 ."
"Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... "

"Most of it is . You should sign up ."
"I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number ."
"Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe ."
"Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number ."
"That's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is ."
"I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it . "
"Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ?"

"my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend ."
"do you still like playing those games ?"
"not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?"
"everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games ."
"some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?"
"no , I prefer to play with people I know ."
"how about mah-jong ?"
"it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it ."

"Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa ."
"I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then ."
"Very well , ma ’ am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ’ s rejected ."
"There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard ."
"Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199.00 , sign here , please ."
"Sure ."
"Here you go , and here ’ s your receipt . Have a nice day ."
"Thanks . You have a good one , too . "
"Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ?"
"Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company ."
"Hush ! The wall has ears , you know ."
"But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy ."
"My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it ."
"What's the meeting for ?"
"It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year ."
"I will be there after 20 minutes . "
"Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ?"
"Let me check . It has a paper jam ."
"I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out ."
"Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . "
"I want to offer you more invoking stock options ."
"When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ?"
"Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists ."
"I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to ."
"Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . "
"Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ?"

"sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice ."
"thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at ."
"it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that ."
"that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer ."
"why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct ."
"I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ?"
"I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly ."
"is it ok to include the pictures ?"
"definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible ."
"thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . "
"Onxiu Travel Agency , may I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China ."
"Your name , please ?"
"Via Kiang . I'd like to leave on May 5th ."
"Let me see what's available . Yes , Air China has a flight on May 5th at nine fifteen in the morning ."

"Would you like anything else ?"
"I'd prefer swordfish steak ."
"I'm sorry.It ' s out of season now ."
"Oysters , please . "
"Sit down , please . Mr . Tang , do you bring any paper or certificate with you ?"
"Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine ."
"Are you still working in Youth International Travel Agency ?"
"Yes , but I am on holidays this week ."
"How many foreign languages can you speak ?"
"I am bilingual , English and Russian . "
"Hi . What can I get for you ?"
"I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please ."
"Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean ."
"Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?"
"No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs ."
"No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here ."
"Okay , is there anything else ?"
"Is this salami and bologna you have here ?"
"Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... , Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it ."
"Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... , Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today ."
"Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . "
"What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably ."
"It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg ."
"Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it ."
"Why ? This is a fair market price ."
"It certainly is ."
"Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly ."
"I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price ."
"We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market ."
"That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price ."
"But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value ."
"I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . "
"Do you shop online often ?"
"Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores ."
"Are there many things online ?"
"Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores ."
"Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket ."
"Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices ."
"What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ?"
"Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . "
"Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking . May I take your order ?"
"Um yes , I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese ."
"We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?"
"Sure , that sounds good ."
"Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?"
"No , make the second one with ham , pineappleand green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust ."
"Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !"
"Perfect . Thank you . Bye ... , Sir , wait ! ! I need your address ! "
"OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ?"
"Almost , let me just put my apron on ."
"OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit ."
"Got it ."
"No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing ."
"Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ?"
"Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients ."
"OK , so now we need a baking pan right ?"
"Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes ."
"Done . So how long do we bake it for ?"
"We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan ."
"Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! "
"Do you have a foreign tour ?"
"Yes , where do you want to go ?"
"Sydney ."
"Would you please look at the five routes ?"
"Well , the route 5 is really charming . Must I make a reservation ?"
"Yes , right now it's the busy season . "
"What ’ s happened ? Is there a problem ?"
"I think the gears have seized up , You'll have to dismantle the unit and lubricate the bearings . Do it as quickly as you can but make sure you top up the oil before you start the motor up again . "
"May , could you tell me how to solve this problem ?"
"That ’ s a secret . I couldn ’ t tell you ."
"Don ’ t give me your attitude . Please tell me . "
"Mr . Chen , I have a Marry from realty world on line one ."
"I don't have time to talk to her now ."
"OK , I'll take a message ."
"Thank you . "
"How do you get along with your boss ?"
"I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals ."
"What do you think is important in your work ?"
"Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . "
"Can you help me find my books ?"
"Certainly , do you have your school schedule ? The books are arranged by course number and instructor ."
"Oh , I see . Thank you . "
"Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night ."
"Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve ."
"Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math ."
"I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom ."
"Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot ."
"Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?"
"Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue ."
"Oh yes , I ... "
"Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?"
"I went to Yale University ."
"Did you ? And what did you study ?"
"I have a B . A . in Economics ."
"Would you mind telling me how old you are ?"
"I'm twenty-seven ."
"And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?"
"Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last five years ."
"And what was your salary at the bank ?"
"I got $ 500 a week . "
"Excuse me . I would like to purchase some travelers ' checks ."
"Sure . How much do you want ?"
"$ 5000 and I want them all in fifties ."
"OK , here you are . Please sign your name here ."
"Thank you . "

"Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods ."
"Just pulling up your information now . Yes , some documents arrived for you from Sapporo ."
"Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ?"
"Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes ."
"No , everything has to be perfect ."
"No problem , I'll just get the form for you . "
"I'd like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ?"
"OK . You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents ."
"I have a driver's licence , a membership card and my passport . Will they do ?"
"Let me see them . Yes , they're OK ."

"You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars ."
"Thank you . "

"Airmail or surface mail ?"
"How long would surface mail take , compared with airmail ?"

"How much would this parcel cost me by airmail ?"
"Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 ."
"Thanks . That'll be OK . "
"Good moming.What can I do for you ?"

"OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank ."
"That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ?"
"It's already credited to your account . "
"Hey Joe , how have you been ?"
"I am doing well . How about you , Mary ?"
"I am doing OK , Joe ."
"There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ?"
"I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her ."
"I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ?"
"Did you have a certain movie in mind ?"
"I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice ."
"I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” , Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! "
"Hello , this is Garry Hao . I am calling to inquire the position of English interpreter ."
"Well , it is still open . Where did you graduate from ."

"Yes , I can . Thank you so much . "
"Walker Airline Travel Agency.May I help you ?"

"I am sorry . All the seats are booked . How about next Monday ?"
"Oh.my god . But I have to be there on Sunday . I want to go on stand-by ."
"OK , sir . I have added your name to the waiting list.We will call you as soon as possible ."

"He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school ."
"What happened ? Have you talked with him ?"
"Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor . "
"Welcome to our company ."
"I really love this kind of atmosphere ."
"An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company ."
"There are people everywhere.What ' s that girl doing ?"
"She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network ."
"And what about that man there ?"
"He is our accountant ."
"I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers ."
"Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . "
"Hello , IBA Bank , how can I help you ?"
"Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal ."
"You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM ."
"Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ?"
"Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal ."
"That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks ! "
"I want to have a continental breakfast ."
"Here is the coffee , toast and bacon . Do you like fried eggs or poached ones ?"
"Neither , can I have them scrambled ?"
"Of course . They will be ready in a few minutes . "
"We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ?"
"Why ?"
"Well , I think we could be saving more ."

"Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month ."
"That's 1,825 dollars ."
"We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account ."
"3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 ."
"Right . "

"Chen Hong , too ."
"Hold on , please . Yes.you ’ re booked on ZN741 to Atlanta on July 18th . Your seats are in the first class section ."
"Thank you vary much . "
"Toronto is really a lovely place to visit ."
"What attracts you most ?"
"The Old Town , the Distillery Historic District , the Financial District and Underground City , everything is so attractive . "
"Is there anything wrong ?"
"I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college ."
"Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager ."
"I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything ."
"You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision ."
"But I just want to give her some tips ."
"Oh , she can make her own decisions ."
"I guess you are right ."
"Believe me . Everything will be ok ."
"I hope so . "
"Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ?"
"Yes . I'd like to try Chinese food . But I don't know anything about it ."
"Chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines , such as Cantonese food , Sichuan food , Fujisan food , etc . Our restaurant is famous for Sichuan style ."
"Is there any difference between Cantonese food and Sichuan food ?"
"Yes . Cantonese food is lighter while Sichuan food is spicy and hot ."
"Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ?"
"How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties ."
"OK . I ’ ll have them . Is there any soup ?"
"Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation ."
"That ’ s fine . I'll have a try ."
"Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ?"
"Martini , please ."
"OK , sir . We'll try our best to serve you as soon as possible . "
"What is your technical title ?"
"I am an Assistant Electronics Engineer ."
"Why do you choose this field as your career ?"
"I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer . "
"I ’ m so frustrated !"
"what ’ s wrong , Jim ?"
"I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted !"
"Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ?"
"yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to ."
"Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ?"
"I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information ."
"Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ?"
"Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! "
"Cool camera . What are its features ?"
"It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient ."
"What about the quality of the pictures ?"
"Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too ."
"Wow ! What about the memory ?"
"It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . "
"Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ?"
"Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting ."
"What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ?"
"First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed ."
"I see , and how about the documents and the information ?"
"All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting ."
"And what should a secretary do during the meeting ?"
"Of course , she should take minutes ."
"And after the meeting ?"
"After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting ."
"It's seriously good . "
"Your definition on success ?"
"Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others ."
"What ’ s your ideal job ?"
"Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting ."
"How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ?"
"Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best ."
"How would your present boss describe you ?"
"He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience ."
"What would your colleagues say about you ?"
"They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . "
"Hello ?"
"Hi , is Heather there please ?"
"Sorry , I think you have the wrong number ."
"Is this 617-228-2289 ?"
"Yes . Who are you looking for again ?"
"Heather Johnson ."
"Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now ."
"Do you know where she went ?"
"She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ?"
"Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ?"
"Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party ."
"Oh , yes . How are you ?"
"Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called ."
"OK . Thanks ."
"Bye bye . "
"I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses ."
"Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand ."
"Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you ."
"Your desire coincides with ours ."
"Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies ."
"Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about benefit between us ."
"That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer ."
"We will make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be put through between us ."
"So do I ."
"I hope everything will be smooth ."
"That is what I want to say ."
"I will give you the lowest price in the future ."
"Thank you ! "
"Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired ."
"Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . "
"Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ?"
"There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding ."
"Trust me . I've been driving for two years ."
"Ok . You drive and do be careful . "
"I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai ?"
"Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle ."
"Too bad . I hate transferring during a flight . It is too complex ."
"You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes ."
"Really ? It used to cost a few hours ."
"It has become more time saving ."
"Ok . Good . I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet . Thank you . "
"Anything else ?"
"Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?"
"Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year ."
"How about sick days ?"
"You get five paid sick days ."
"Any other benefits ?"
"Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well ."
"Great . Thanks so much for your time ."
"We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . "
"What is your greatest strength ?"
"I feel my greatest asset is perseverance , that is , the ability to stick to things to get them done ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned . "
"Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?"
"Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ?"
"No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?"
"Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop ."
"I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological ."
"I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people ."
"So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet ."
"Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something ."

"Where did you go to university ?"
"My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature ."

"I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books , Did you always know you wanted to be a writer ?"
"No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge ."
"How did you start writing ?"
"I started writing margin articles for fun , and eventually was asked to write a book , so I was pretty lucky ."
"Are you writing a book now ?"
"Yes , it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country , and all the strange experiences they have , Sounds interesting . "
"Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing ."
"Why do you say that ?"
"I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight ."
"Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary ."
"I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door ."
"Is the security door useful ?"
"Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in ."
"I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away ."
"OK , I will do it right now . "
"Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved !"
"Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard ."

"Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind ."
"In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . "
"Hi , do you know a place that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ?"
"An outlet carries cheap cashmere sweaters ."

"How far do we have to go ?"
"About 50 miles ."

"But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ?"
"Right . "
"Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information ."

"Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ?"
"Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken ."
"That sounds very interesting !"
"Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine ."
"Thank you very much . "
"Please file all the reports for me ."

"I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs ."
"Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday ."
"Have you had any experience as a guide ?"
"Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing ."
"Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing ."
"I think I would like that . "
"Mr . Jackson , I've drafted a schedule for your business trip next week . You may have a look ."
"Oh , great ! Let's discuss it together . Now , when am I off then ?"
"You're leaving on Tuesday morning ."

"in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people ."
"maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they , yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish , then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people ."
"well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea , what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend , well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . "
"We did a survey on your job performance ."
"How did I do ?"
"Not so good . Lots of complains ."
"Really ? I thought I was doing well ."
"Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . "
"How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina ."
"Glad to meet you , Mrs.Tina ."
"Please have a seat . I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service ."

"Exactly my understanding ."
"A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company.Any extended illness will be covered by insurance.Have you read the other terms of the contract ?"
"Yes , I have ."
"Do you have any other questions ?"
"Just one . I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ?"
"Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager ."
"That's acceptable ."
"Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . "
"That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled ."
"Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry ."
"I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace ."
"Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same ."
"What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ?"
"If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ?"
"Yes . "
"Is this your first time visiting Beijing ?"
"Yes . Is it easy to get around ?"
"I think so . You can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive ."
"How about the subway ?"
"It's also convenient , but it's usually crowded . "
"Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ?"
"I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you ."
"Are you an existing customer ?"
"Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card ."
"May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance ."
"When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead ."
"That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments ."
"As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . "
"Good morning , I would like to make a doctor ’ s appointment ."

"Yes , I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital ."

"A little over 3 years ."
"In what section did you work in the hospital ?"
"I worked in the Infection Medicine Division . "
"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator ."
"Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works ."
"I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice ."
"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution ."
"Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down ."
"Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . "
"Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages !"
"I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ?"
"Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?"
"Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? "
"Help me sort out my problem , will you ?"
"OK , but I think you should keep an eye on your plan if you see what I mean ."
"I know it ’ s so costly , but ... , No buts . The thing is to cut down your expense , Judie . "
"Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ?"
"That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first ."
"Or they'll take over the market before we even get started ."
"Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer ."
"I guess we'd better get back to work . "
"Excuse me . May I see Mrs . Smith ?"
"It's me . What can I do for you ?"
"Nice to meet you , Mrs . Smith . I'm coming here for an interview by appointment ."
"Are you Mr . Wu ?"
"Yes , I am ."
"Nice to meet you , too . Did you have any difficulty finding our company ?"
"Not really , I am familiar with this area . "
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything ."
"Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain ."
"When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ?"
"First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling ."
"I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day ."
"It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! "
"I wonder if you can help me . I ’ m looking for a room ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve get a small room ."
"How much do you charge ?"
"35.00 dollars a week , but I don ’ t allow smoking ."
"OK.Can I see the room now ?"
"Would you mind waiting ? I ’ m on the telephone . "
"Where are you going to play this weekend ?"
"I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ?"
"I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ?"
"I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian ."
"Do you want to climb the mountain with us ?"
"Does it have enough lodging ?"
"No problem . The temple is quite large ."
"There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees ."
"I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ?"
"Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' ."
"Anything else I should bring ?"
"If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you ."
"Needless to say . "
"Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ?"
"Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ?"
"I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ?"

"I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too ."

"Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye . "
"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” , Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite ."
"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ?"
"The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ?"
"Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits ."
"It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ?"
"Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” "
"Actually , you can take advantage of our "" New Millennium Woman "" promotion ."
"Does that include some kind of "" Love , Amy Card "" ?"
"Yes . If your "" Love , Amy "" purchases amount to 10,000 NT or more , you get a V . I . P . card and a 20 percent discount ."
"Mmmm ... I'll have to think about it ."
"OK . Just think for a bit . I'll go help another customer . I'll be right back . "
"My name is James Owen . I ’ m Manager of Sales . How do you do ?"
"How do you do ?"

"Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society ."
"That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes ."
"But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year ."
"Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal ."
"No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite ."
"And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' ."
"The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' ."
"I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . "
"This is the rush hour ."
"I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away ."
"Let ’ s drive off this road ."
"I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . "
"My wife is in labor !"
"Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher ."
"Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ’ s our doctor . We called her from the car ."
"Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way ."
"Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks ."
"How long has she been in labor ?"
"About fifteen minutes ."
"O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ?"
"Yes ."
"Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"I'd like to have a sightseeing tour in South Africa . Do you provide a package tour ?"
"Yes , sir ."
"What interesting places shall we visit ?"
"We'll visit the generally well-known spots ."
"How many days shall we spend on the trip ?"
"Five days ' time will be OK ."
"Sounds good . "
"What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ?"
"I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !"
"But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?"
"They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though ."
"So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ?"
"Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert ."
"How about drinking soda ?"
"Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever ."
"And have you ever tried taking vitamins ?"
"I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start ."
"How do you know so much about food and dieting ?"
"You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! "
"How are you making out these days ?"
"He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . "
"Hello , is that Miss Lan ? This is Nina with Huawei Corp ."
"Yes , speaking ."
"I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us ."
"Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs ."
"I see . "
"I have a good feeling about this house ."
"Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it ."
"I love the paint job !"
"If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside ."
"What a beautiful home !"
"You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new ."
"I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street ."
"Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it ."
"I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen ."
"The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom ."
"I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering !"
"Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home . "
"Can I help you , Sir ?"
"Yes , I'd like to withdraw some money ."
"Fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw , please ."
"OK . Here's my bank book , is that all right ?"
"OK , do you want large notes or small ones ?"
"In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine ."
"Here's the cash for you ."
"Thanks . "
"Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ?"
"Yes , we have insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment , work injury and childbirth ."
"How are they get paid ?"
"Insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment will be paid by both the company and you , and the others by the company . "
"How was your shopping trip Martin ?"
"Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far ."
"Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ?"
"I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops ."
"And how did you get around town ?"
"I took a taxi . It seemed the easiest thing to do ."
"Right , so you didn ’ t get lost ?"
"I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way ! "
"I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much ."
"I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ?"
"20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ?"
"Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things ."
"Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ?"
"Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look ."
"The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ?"
"No problem ."
"That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . "
"The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made ."
"Is there anything special they would like to do ?"
"They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing ."
"That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ?"
"They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention ."
"I will set it up ."
"They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . "
"Yes , Mr . Emory ?"
"I need the number for John Reese ’ s office ."
"Just one moment , sir . Here you are – 767-4512 . "
"What should you do if you find out a man may has an illegal departure in exit control point ?"
"We can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport ."
"What else do you need to keep him in temporary custody ?"
"We need a detention warrant . "
"Good morning , Mary ."
"How do you want your egg cooked ?"
"Sunny side up , please ."
"Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes . "
"morning . Macmillan and Emory . May I help you ?"
"Is this the accounting department ?"
"No , I ’ m sorry . You ’ Ve reached Mr . Macmillan ’ s office . Let me just put you through to accounting ."
"Thanks . I appreciate that . "
"Good morning.My name's Pat Green ."
"Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ?"
"I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant ."
"Yes.Are you interested in the job ?"
"I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ?"
"Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ?"
"I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school ."
"Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ?"
"How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ?"
"Ten hours a week.From Monday to Friday , from 4 to 6 P . m ."
"and $ 150 a week ."
"OK , I'll take it ."
"Fine.Please fill out the application form . "
"My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one ."
"Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' , That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night ."
"Okay , let me see what I can do for you ."
"Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple ."
"I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service ."
"Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ?"
"Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed ."
"This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again !"
"I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . "
"First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us ."
"We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face ."
"I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market ."
"We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too ."
"I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it ."
"We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent ."
"I'll come to that . My proposal is , As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ?"
"Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ?"
"Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % ."
"You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown ."
"On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty ."
"Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ?"
"Tomorrow afternoon ."
"Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . "
"I have a package to post today ."
"Yes , what's in the package , madam ?"
"Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape ."
"How would you like to send it ?"
"By airmail please ."
"Do you want to insure it ?"
"Yes , I'd like to insure it for 20 dollars . How much shall I pay altogether ?"
"3 dollars . "
"What reasons do westerners drink for ?"
"I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine ."
"I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship ."
"And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink "" one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste ."
"Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable ."
"Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! "
"This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ?"
"It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city ."
"100th anniversary ? When was that ?"
"Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself ."
"Sounds real good . It's a pity that I missed that ."
"Yes . We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday . It made the people feel so proud of our city . "
"An interesting meeting , isn't it ?"
"Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good ."
"Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown ."
"How do you do ? I'm Mary Green ."
"Sorry , what was your last name again ?"
"Green , G-R-E-E-N , but just call me Mary ."
"OK . I'm Dick ."
"Glad to meet you . "
"Excuse me , is there a Post Office around here ?"
"Yes . There's one on the corner of 23th street ."
"How do I get there from here ?"
"Just walk north for 3 blocks . It's next to the Mexico restaurant ."
"How far is that ?"
"Oh , very close . Maybe 5 minutes walk . "
"Take me to this address , please ."
"Yes , ma'am . Here we are ."
"How much do I owe you , sir ?"
"30 dollars , ma'am ."
"Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ?"
"Yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip , too ."
"I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then ."
"OK , ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . "
"Carla , I know you ’ re kind of new in this business and I want to give you some advice ."
"Yes , Mr . Michael ?"
"You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes ."
"I ’ m sorry , Mr . Michael . Could you tell me where the problems are exactly ? Maybe I misunderstood the client ’ s intentions . "
"I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning ."
"To visit our supplier ?"
"Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers ."
"Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase ."
"Sure ."
"By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?"
"No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me ."
"Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything ."
"I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ?"
"I am not sure . You can check with the finance department ."
"I will call them this afternoon , thanks ."
"You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . "
"Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ?"
"What ’ s to get ready ?"
"Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ?"
"Nope ."
"Have you updated your CV ?"
"Nope . "
"Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ?"
"Not yet , Mr . Wang . But I'm working on it ."
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"I just keep getting a busy signal ."
"Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him ."
"All right , I'll let you know when I get through . "
"How do I set up an E-mail account ?"
"Oh , that's easy . Go to www.onxiu.cn . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope ."
"Which link ?"
"That one , the one that says Mail ."
"Oh , no . What did I do ? It's asking me for a password ."
"Don't worry . See where it says , New User ?"
"Yes ."
"Click on that ."
"Oh , I see ."
"Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . "
"It ’ s very nice to meet you ."
"Nice meeting you , too ."
"I can ’ t believe I ’ m actually speaking to a candidate ."
"You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like ."
"I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage ."
"Everyone should be able to love who they want ."
"Would you make gay marriage legal ?"
"I sure would ."
"I know a lot of people wouldn ’ t agree with that ."
"That ’ s not my problem ."
"I think that is really cool of you ."
"I ’ m glad to hear that . "
"Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck ."
"You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair ."
"Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ?"
"OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay ."
"Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work ."
"All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now ."
"That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take ."
"Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ?"
"That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead ."
"I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan ."
"No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation ."
"Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! "
"Hello . How can we be of service ?"
"I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan ."
"OK , are you already an account holder ?"
"Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible ."
"To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ... , For my credit worthiness ?"
"Yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management . "
"Hello sir , how can I help you ?"
"Yes , I need this prescription please ."
"Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?"
"Capsules are fine ."
"Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day.Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol !"
"Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose !"
"Okay , anything else I can get you ?"
"Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ?"
"Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system ."
"Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem ."
"Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on Fun Times Ribbed Condoms please ! "
"How much tea are you going to order ?"
"We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots ."
"When do you want to deliver the goods ?"
"We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 ."
"I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases ."
"I can agree to that ."
"Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ?"
"Right ."
"Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything ."
"Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . "
"Do I often have to work overtime ?"
"Yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job ."
"Is there any extra pay for that ?"
"No , but we ’ ll provide you with good businesses at the end of the year . "
"Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan ."
"Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ?"
"No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations ."
"We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor ."
"Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year ."
"Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . "
"Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ?"
"Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ?"
"Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment ."
"OK . Would you like to live in a studio ?"
"Sure , a studio would be fine . "
"Can I help you , Ma'am ?"
"I need a phone card for this new cell phone ."
"Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ?"
"It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student ."
"Then the M-Zone will be suitable ."
"What's special with the service ?"
"You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that ."
"That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card ."
"Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now ."
"Oh , good . Then what is it ?"
"If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free ."
"May I have two of them ?"
"Sure . As many as you want ."
"Okay , then a third one for my husband too . "
"Can I see your passport , please ?"
"Is this line for non-residents ?"
"Yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right ."
"Ok . Here's my passport ."
"What's the expiration date on your passport ?"
"I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page ."
"I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK ."
"I won't ."
"Do you have anything to declare ?"
"No , I don't have anything to declare ."
"How long will you be staying in the UK ?"
"I'll be here for about a year ."
"What is the purpose of your stay ?"
"I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University ."
"Where will you be staying ?"
"I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus ."
"How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ?"
"My father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts ."
"Ok . Have a good stay . Here's your passport and documents back ."
"Thank you very much . "
"Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute ."
"Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ?"
"Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule ."
"Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . "
"Hi . You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ?"
"Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler ."
"Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV !"
"After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it ."
"Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?"
"These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add ."
"Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ?"
"Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan ."
"Right . What are you doing over there ?"
"I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! "
"Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory ."
"Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? "
"Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ?"
"Yes , it's definitely a growing business ."
"What do you recycle in your plant ?"
"Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away ."
"How is plastic recycled , then ?"
"Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals ."
"Is that the method you use here ?"
"No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products ."
"How do you do that ?"
"By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . "
"What is a visa used for ?"
"It is a significant document for traveling abroad and visiting ."
"Oh . Where do I need to apply for a visa ?"
"There are passport processing center in many places . Visa is dealt with in embassies . You need to complete several forms and provide certain certificate ."
"Does it take a long time to get a visa ?"
"Not too long . 14 working days for a visa ."
"What materials do I need to provide ?"
"Your passport and ID card . "
"How do I take the tablets ?"
"Please take 2 tablets each time , 4 times a day ."
"How do I take the sucking lozenges ?"
"Please put one under your tongue , do not swallow it ."
"How do I take the pills ?"
"Please dissolve one pill in water before taking it ."
"Well , thanks very much ."
"You're welcome . "
"Do I need a visa ?"
"No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course ."
"Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency ."
"Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them ."
"Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing ."
"You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine ."
"That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long ."
"Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . "
"Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ?"
"I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross ."
"Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?"
"For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !"
"Have you treated any real emergencies ?"
"Well , they took us along with some paramedics . There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !"
"I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! "

"Is there anything I can do for you ?"

"Shall I go ahead and process them for you ?"
"Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye ! "
"What characteristics should an interpreter own ?"
"I think he should be an expert of everything ."
"Why is that ?"
"Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . "
"Well , Miss Liu , I've enjoyed talking with you . Thank you for your interest in this job ."
"It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ?"

"Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . "
"Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ?"
"Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily ."
"But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same ."
"More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . "
"Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?"
"I want to have a suit made to measure ."
"No problem . How would you like your suit ?"
"One Made in 100 % black Barathea wool , with 5 Celtic buttons ."

"Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ?"
"Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week ."
"Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . "
"I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position ."
"Very well , do you know any shorthand ?"
"No , but I can write very fast ."
"Can you use the computer or other office machines ?"
"No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them ."

"Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ?"
"Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time ."
"I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . "
"Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ?"
"I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have ."
"Is rice your staple food , too ?"
"Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . "
"Waiter , please make out the bill ."
"OK , sir . How do you like your meal ?"
"Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak ."
"I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all ."
"Here is the money . "
"Can I ask you what the office rules are ?"
"Yes , do you know the nine to five timetable ?"
"Is it from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon ?"
"Yes , you are right . "
"How are you feeling ?"
"Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning ."
"You said you never went to hospital ."
"I will get better soon ."
"The good thing is you don't need to go to school ."
"Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams ."
"And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for ."
"Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it ."
"I really envy you , Danny ."
"Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles ."
"Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection ."
"May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale ."
"No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel ."
"Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ?"
"OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ?"
"Deal . "
"Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson ."
"I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ?"
"I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies ."
"Have you got any selling experience at all ?"
"I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation ."
"Now tell me about your educational background ."
"I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration ."
"What courses have you completed ?"
"The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology ."
"What subjects did you like most at university ?"
"I liked sales strategies most ."
"Why would you like to work with us ?"
"It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university ."
"What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ?"
"I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing ."
"Good . Do you know anything about this company ?"
"Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products ."
"Have you got anything to ask me ?"
"Will traveling be required in this position ?"
"Yes ."
"How often ?"
"Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ?"
"That's fine . "
"May I help you ?"
"I'm just browsing , thanks ."
"We're on clearance sale now . Prices have up to twenty percent off . Do not miss the chance ."
"Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat ."
"Madam , you know we ’ re clearing out stock now . It ’ s a real bargain ."
"So won ’ t you come down any more ?"
"Thirty percent discount , OK ? That ’ s the lowest price . "
"What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ?"
"Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events ."
"What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... , It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness ."
"Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ?"
"We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program ."
"Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ?"
"It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . "
"I'm checking out in about half an hour ."
"Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir ."
"Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun ."
"You're right . It's only 9 , Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags ."
"Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit ."
"My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ?"
"Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though ."
"Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment ."
"Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour . "
"I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing ."
"How about this set ?"
"Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . "
"Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ?"
"I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting ."
"Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ?"
"I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . "
"Here comes the bus . I'll ring you up later ."
"See you !"
"See you ! "
"How do you understand the organizational structure of a company ?"
"The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority ."
"Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes , companies have structures that define theirs ?"
"Yes , you are right . "
"Hello . Dr . Brown ’ s Dental Office . How can I help you ?"
"Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ’ m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3 , What happened ?"
"I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ?"
"Sure , you can , but you ’ ll be charged for $ 10 ."
"Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ?"
"This is for the delayed cancellation . Because this time is reserved for you . If you are unable to keep an appointment , you should notify us 48 hours in advance . Otherwise , the charge will be made ."
"I see . That ’ s ok . I ’ ll pay ."
"Thanks for your understanding . Do you want to make another appointment ?"
"No . Not right now . When I feel better I ’ ll call you again ."
"Ok . Take care ."
"Thank you . "
"What's wrong with the photocopier ?"
"The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard ."
"I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . "
"Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic !"
"If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy !"
"He sounds like a sick cow !"
"Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key ."
"I already tried that . Nothing seems to help ."
"Hey ! Where are you going ... ?"
"Coing out for a walk . "
"Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale . Please sit down ."
"Thank you ."
"Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ?"
"Only as a clerk in a store ."
"I see . Well , consulting is a little different ."
"I'm a quick learner , Mr.Jenkins ."
"Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?"
"Yes , and I'm a very good driver ."
"Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants ."
"Do I have to travel a lot ?"
"Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory ."
"But how will I get to know the products ?"
"You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours ."
"How much is the salary ?"
"Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course ."
"How much commission do your consultants get ?"
"Five percent ."
"Well , I'm very interested in the job ."
"Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow ."
"Thank you ."
"Good luck to you . "
"What kind of personality do you think you have ?"
"I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished ."
"What makes you angry ?"
"Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable . "
"Would you mind answering a few personal questions ?"
"Of course not ."
"OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ?"
"Yes . I gave her my resignation a few days ago ."
"Will she let you leave your present job ?"
"Yes , I think she will ."
"Why do you want to leave your present job ?"
"Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay ."
"I appreciate you frankness . Do you know anything about our company ?"
"Yes . It's a Korea company and it was built in Beijing five years ago . "
"Hello , Westhaven Company ."
"Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ?"
"This is Michael Richard speaking . Who is calling ?"
"Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday ."
"You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ?"
"I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position ."
"We have made the decision to hire you ."
"Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions ."
"I will , thank you for calling . "
"What ’ s up ?"
"I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ?"
"Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ?"
"Of course not , I appreciate that ."
"Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity ."
"I see . What can I do now ?"
"You can send a compressed one . "
"That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal ."
"Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well ."
"To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us ."
"Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you ."
"Excellent . Have you had French food before ?"
"Oh , yes . Marvelous ! "
"We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better ."
"Can I ask what the position pays ?"
"Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ?"
"My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan ."
"I see . Including bonus ?"
"Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well ."
"What starting salary would you expect here ?"
"I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month . "
"What is included in a job advertisement ?"
"Generally speaking , there are the company , the job title , job description , requirement , and so on ."
"What are the accesses of the job ads ?"
"There are many sources , such as newspaper , Internet and direct visit . "
"IBA , how can I help ?"
"Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too ."
"That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... , I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller ."
"This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . "
"How may I help you . sir ?"
"I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight ."
"Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ?"
"Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ?"
"150 yuan for hard seats ."
"Fine ."
"Sir ?"
"Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! "
"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?"
"Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one ."
"That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too ."
"Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients ."
"Did you buy new cupboards too ?"
"No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added ."
"I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils ."
"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over ."
"Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food ."
"Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket ."
"I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! "
"Yes . Of my mother standing in the kitchen and me doing my homework before school ... , How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ... , OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it ."
"Isn't the shape cool ?"
"Yeah , and it's bigger than ours was ."
"Hey ! What's that smell ? Are you burning the toast ? "
"When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ?"
"It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms.Barkley ."
"That shouldn't be a problem . What is the exact address , again ?"
"7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 . "
"Telco Mobile , how can I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please ."
"Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling ."
"Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ?"
"Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate ."
"Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number ."
"Yes of course . We can activate all these services in about an hour . "
"Can I help you ?"
"My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour . Can you arrange it ?"
"Yes , we can arrange that ."
"I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has ."
"Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours , ranging from individual tour to group package tour ."
"Excellent ."
"When do you expect to come ?"
"September 28th ."
"What specific places do you wish to visit ?"
"We would like to visit the Great Wall , the Ming Tombs and the Imperial Palace ."
"OK . "
"Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ?"
"It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week ."
"He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him ."
"He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything !"
"Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . "
"Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day ."
"Okay . Is all going well ?"
"I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer ."
"Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ?"
"We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details ."
"OK . If he wants to make any changes , minor alternations can be accepted . Let me know what happens ."
"OK . I never forget it . "
"How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ?"
"If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction ."
"Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them ."
"Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers ."
"Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . "
"What's the life expectancy in your country ?"
"I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?"
"About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world ."
"I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly ."
"Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday ."
"Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment ."
"How's your son these days ?"
"Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays ."
"He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?"
"I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career ."
"Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet ."
"Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ?"
"Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour , Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom ."
"It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . "
"Hello . Front desk . How can I help you ?"
"Good evening . Is the kitchen open now ?"
"I ’ m sorry . The kitchen is closed after midnight ."
"It ’ s ok , good night ."
"Good night . "
"Hey , daughter , let me ask you something ."
"Yes , dad ?"
"Do you have life insurance ?"
"Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay ."
"You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?"
"That ’ s true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?"
"A $ 100,000 policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He ’ ll give you a good deal . "
"What's wrong ?"
"There's no power ."
"Have you checked the fuse box ?"
"Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out ."
"There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . "
"I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up ."
"You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help ."
"What do you mean ?"
"I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter ."
"You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either ."
"Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun ."
"Do you have anyone in mind ?"
"Actually I do ."
"Who ?"
"Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field ."
"Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ?"
"Not at the moment , but I ’ ll let you know . "
"Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window ."
"What's the matter , sir ?"
"Have you been drinking ?"
"No , I haven't sir ."
"Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please ."
"But , sir , I didn't drink at all ."
"If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment ."
"OK . I'll blow ."
"Your BAC exceeds the legal limit ."
"But I ... , I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . "
"Do you know who that tall man is ?"
"He's a member of the National Basketball Association ."
"Do you know where he comes from ?"
"Some people say he's from New York . "
"Look , there is traffic accident over there ."
"What happened ?"
"The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . "
"Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ?"
"I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today ."
"Yes . It'll be at three o'clock this afternoon ."
"I'm afraid we have to reschedule it ."
"Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ?"
"I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away ."
"How about Friday afternoon ?"
"That'll be fine . "
"One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for ."
"Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ?"
"He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review ."
"Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ?"
"Actually not ! Our company pays for performance ."
"I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . "
"Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check ."
"Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ?"
"Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them ."
"Do you mean all the sales letters from them ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right ."
"I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ?"
"Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper ."
"No problem . "
"This is Milton in room 402 . I would like to check out . Can anyone help me with my baggage ?"
"Yes . The porter will go and help you ."
"Thanks a lot . By the way , please call a taxi for me ."
"OK , sir . "
"What is your favorite kind of music ?"
"I listen to various types of music ."
"What genres ?"
"I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B ."
"What interests you in that type of music ?"
"I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use ."
"That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music ."
"That's exactly what I think too . "
"You want to go get a facial with me today ?"
"Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that ."
"Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good ."
"True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?"
"Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks ."
"That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day ."
"Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it ."
"Uh ... no . "
"Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ?"
"Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know ."
"You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll ."
"Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie ."
"She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ?"
"Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29.95 plus tax ."
"Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course ."
"Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ?"
"Thank you , but no . This will do it for now ."
"Tax brings your total to $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ?"
"Cash , please ."
"Here's your change . Thank you . "
"Well , that was an interesting documentary !"
"For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US ."
"Like what ?"
"Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ?"
"Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg ."
"That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that ."
"That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?"
"Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank ."
"I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! "
"how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?"
"I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me ."
"do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?"
"I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?"
"I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! "
"What salary are you expecting ?"
"What range of salary do you have for this position ?"
"It can be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 a year depending on experience and qualifications ."
"It sounds amazing to me . "
"To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ?"
"First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record.Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business ."
"Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ?"
"I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions ."
"Do you have any questions about the job ?"
"Yes . Are the chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ?"
"Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas ."
"That would be good . "
"pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?"
"sure , here you are ."
"thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?"
"yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better ."
"well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies ."
"Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u , yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes ."
"I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt ."
"yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do ."
"exactly . "
"OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ?"
"I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?"
"Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !"
"I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night ."
"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him ."
"I'll put the song at the front of the list . "
"Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles ."
"You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport ."
"What do you think might be the source of its popularity ?"
"I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... , And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks ."
"Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket ."
"Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport , Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it ."
"I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong ."
"Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign ."
"I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? "
"Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters ."
"Great . Where is it ?"
"A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area ."
"What about the surrounding area ?"
"Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants ."
"That's good . Is the location easily accessible ?"
"Yeah , it's near a bus stop ."
"Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . "
"The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ?"
"By credit card ."
"We take Visa and Master Card ."
"Do you take American Express ?"
"No , we don't ."
"Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are ."
"Thank you ... please sign on the line . "
"The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database ."
"I think the file is too big . You'll need to expand your memory . First , close down all the files you have open , and then ... "
"It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot !"
"Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot ."
"You mean half-and-half ?"
"Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames ."
"Good idea ."
"Let's go ! "
"Hello , miss . Where is the button that controls my seat ?"
"It's on the arm rest ."
"Oh , I see . By the way , what shall I do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ?"
"You can suck a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out . That shall help . "
"Do you have all types of seafood here ?"
"Yes , Sir , the specialty of our restaurant is the seafood ."

"Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much ."
"OK , we will try it ."
"Any drinks ?"
"Two bottles of white wine , please . "
"Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form ."
"Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ?"
"Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion ."
"Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ?"
"Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar ."
"Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . "
"What kind of personality do you think you have ?"
"I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done ."
"Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?"
"I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others ."
"What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?"
"I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better ."
"What kind of people do you like to work with ?"
"People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . "
"Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ?"
"Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so ."
"I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen ."
"Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service ."
"Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ?"
"Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract ."
"I see . "
"What about the working hours ?"
"Working conditions are very relaxed . You may work whatever hours you want , provided you get your job done properly ."
"I like flexible hours ."
"Would you mind changing the position or working place you've applied for ?"
"No , I don't . "
"How was your appraisal with the boss ?"
"Oh it was really good . Do you know , he ’ s the nicest boss I ’ Ve had here ."
"Yes , I think he ’ s the most relaxed person in management ."
"What ’ s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office !"
"That ’ s good . Maybe you ’ ll get promoted ."
"I hope so . Then I ’ ll be the happiest person in our office too ! "
"Welcome . How can I help you ?"
"Hello , I would like a room please ."
"All right . We have quite a selection for you to choose from . There are double rooms with twin beds , suites , if you'd like , we have presidential suite on the top floor ."
"A double room sounds great ."
"All right sir . How many nights will you be staying ?"
"A few nights , I'm not quite sure of my schedule yet ."
"OK . I'll just need to see a credit card and passport ."
"Here you are ."
"What is the rate for a double room for one night ?"
"Since it is low season , we are running a special rate right now of 150 yuan per night ."
"What about the features in the room ?"
"Our rooms include television set , air-conditioning and a bathroom ."
"Does the TV have cable ?"
"Yes , sir . "

"OK . Everything is in the bag ."
"Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . "
"Good morning , I am here for my interview ."
"Hello , nice to meet you . I ’ m Mr . Gotcha . Have any trouble finding the place ?"
"No problem ."
"So why don ’ t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ?"
"Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy ."
"What would you consider your strengths ?"
"I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes ."
"What is your biggest weakness ?"
"I tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged ."
"We have a position where that could work out well . "
"When can I move into my new house ?"
"The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday ."
"Will the utilities be turned on ?"
"You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name ."
"I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned ."
"If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in ."
"I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in ."
"That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away ."
"Can you help me on my move-in day ?"
"I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . "
"My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that ."
"Wow . You are a real snake ."
"It's business , Dave ."
"I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ?"
"Right . The faint of heart should not apply ."
"I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself ."
"So do I . "
"Do you know what exporters consider ?"
"Well , they consider some distinct but related problems , such as seeking for a target market or locating the promising customer . An exporter needs to know about the social characteristics of people he is dealing with ."
"Could you talk about it in detail ?"
"Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow . Especially you need to know how they behave , their habits and their way of life , the things that they are used to . Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious ."
"I understand . Thank you . "
"Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny ."
"It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson ."
"And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ?"
"I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes !"
"That's great . And the garbage , too ?"
"Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now ."
"Thanks for your help ! "
"Haven't run into you for ages !"
"It really is.You ' Ve changed so much ."
"Really ? "
"Good morning , Mr Bell . How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ?"
"Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 ."
"I see , here it says KM509 ."
"Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match ."
"Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents . "
"Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises ."
"The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism ."
"In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 , Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive ."
"How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ?"
"Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country ."
"As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ?"
"The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues ."
"Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years ."
"Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . "
"I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight . Do you think you'll have time ?"

"We boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem ."
"Then what ? Your plane was three hours late !"
"We finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight ."
"Turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?"
"Yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early ."
"So where did you land ?"
"We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again ."
"That sounds like a nightmare !"
"It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive ."
"Have you had anything to eat ?"
"I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?"
"I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! "

"Anything else ?"
"Then you should write your objectives , such as seeking a position in foreign trade ."
"I see . It is the position desired , Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience ."

"What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ?"
"Cartons . Is that okay ?"
"I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about ."
"Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof ."
"In that case , I guess I can rest assured ."
"Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too ."
"You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ?"
"We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher ."
"It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons ."
"Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . "

"One economy , please . "
"Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ?"
"In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars ."
"That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do ."
"You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer ."
"If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ?"
"Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do ."
"Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer ."
"I will contact the sellers with your current offer ."
"Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ?"
"Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one . "

"In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style ."
"No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers ."
"Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ?"
"My destination is Rockefeller Center ."
"What time do you want to leave the hotel ?"
"As soon as possible ."
"I'll call the taxi immediately , sir ."
"Okay , I'm coming downstairs now ."
"A brand new taxi is pulling up now . "
"You ’ re free to go ."
"That ’ s great ."
"What are your plans now that you ’ re getting out ?"
"I want to go back to school ."
"What is your major going to be ?"
"I haven ’ t decided yet ."
"I hope I don ’ t ever see you back in here ."
"I ’ m never coming back ."
"This really isn ’ t the place for you ."
"I realize that ."
"Good luck out there ."

"Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation ."
"There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ?"
"Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor ."
"That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space ."
"Have you taken this to the property management , yet ?"
"No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking ."
"Where ? On the road ?"
"No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed ."
"Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ?"
"Yes ! How do you know that ?"
"That's my wife ! "
"Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?"
"No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream ."
"What's that ?"
"It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit ."
"Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?"
"Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska ."
"Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ?"
"Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian ."
"God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight !"
"That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! "
"What do you consider to be your strong points ?"
"I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally ."

"Really ? Are you still playing ?"
"Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates ."
"I see . You must be tough ."
"I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football ."
"What do you consider to be your weak points ?"
"Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late ."
"What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ?"
"So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working ."
"Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ?"
"It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . "
"What would be my daily duties ?"
"Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors ."
"Got it . To whom should I report ?"
"Of course to me . "
"Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ?"
"Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting ."
"Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . "
"Can anyone tell me where I can buy the ingredients to make Chinese food ?"
"There is a supermarket in Kensington High Street . I'll come and give you a hand ."
"That is good of you ."
"Here , take one of these trolleys . What do you want exactly ?"

"He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting ."
"I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ? "
"How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?"
"Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles ."
"Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control ."
"No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . "
"Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ?"
"Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports ."
"Can you give an example ?"
"For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction ."
"Why ?"
"This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives ."
"Oh , Are there other means ?"
"Technical barriers are set for imported goods ."
"This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ?"
"Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food . "
"Oh dear , I ’ m late . I have to be in the office by 8am ."
"Oh really what ’ s happening ?"
"Well there is an important meeting with a new client ."
"Ok but you must stay calm . Do you want me to give you a lift ?"
"Oh , you don ’ t have to do that but it would be a great help ."
"Ok , wait one minute . I must remember where I left the keys . "
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything ."
"Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain , When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ?"
"First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling ."
"I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day ."
"It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! "
"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?"
"Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section ."
"Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section ."
"Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?"
"It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad ."
"It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !"
"It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante ."
"Is that better ?"
"Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?"
"Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make ."
"That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship . "
"Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson ."
"Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled ."
"Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement ."
"Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ?"
"I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . "
"Are you going to vote ?"
"Yes , are you ?"
"Yeah , but what day are the elections ?"
"You don ’ t know what day the elections are ?"
"That ’ s why I ’ m asking you ."
"They ’ re this coming Tuesday ."
"Really ?"
"Yes , I ’ m serious ."
"Good thing you told me ."
"I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were ."
"It slipped my mind ."
"You should watch the news more often . "
"I really think all Americans look alike ."
"You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough ."
"But they do ."
"What makes you say that ?"
"They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum ."
"I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look !"
"Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . "
"Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now !"
"Is everything OK ?"
"Just get over here ! Come in ! Quickly !"
"So , since when is your house a bank ?"
"What do you mean ?"
"I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows ."
"Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window ."
"What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ?"
"Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis ."
"OK , well , what did you want to see me about ?"
"You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! "
"I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ?"
"Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium ."
"I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ?"
"My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure ."
"Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young ."
"Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age ."
"Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet ."
"I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too ."
"So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level ."
"I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently ."
"That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . "
"This is the Pan-American Club . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday . Could you give me some more information about that ?"
"Yes , of course . The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America ."
"Mmm , that sounds very interesting . "
"Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman ."
"How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ?"
"No , I'm not asking for money , I'm asking for your advice ."
"Oh , you've already grown up , son . "
"We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ?"
"It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned ."
"What is your greatest weakness ?"
"Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule ."
"What is the greatest disappointment in your life ?"
"Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me ."
"Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ?"
"I will start my work at the beginning of next month . "
"Do you have deviled crabs ?"
"Yes , sir . It's the specialty of our restaurant ."
"I want an order of that . By the way , I want it hot . I like chili ."
"OK , sir . Don't you want to have some drinks ?"
"Bring me a bottle of beer . "
"What can I do for you ?"
"Yes , I made a reservation for 3 days for April 3rd to 6th , and my name is Sara ."
"Yes , what's the problem ?"
"Well , I want to extend it for 2 more nights ."
"So you will stay until 9th ?"
"Yes ."
"OK , we'll make the correction for you ."
"Thank you . "
"My minibar is completely empty ."
"Everything in that minibar has been consumed , sir ?"
"Everything's gone ."
"Is there anything special you'd like ?"
"Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier ."
"Okay , sir . Three of each . Would you like anything else ?"
"The fruit basket was great . I need a few more apples , please ."
"Perrier , Jim Beam , and apples . Is that it for now ?"
"Yes , one last thing , Your order will be brought to you momentarily , sir . "
"Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?"
"That depends . What does she look like ?"

"Is she chubby ?"
"Not at all . She's actually very athletic ."

"It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one ."
"Even her mom ?"
"Yes , even her mom ."
"What's her personality like ?"

"Can I help you ?"
"I'd like two kilos of eggs ."
"What kind ?"
"Do you have the eggs with the red yolk ?"

"Oh ... , It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes ."
"Sorry , love ."
"What are you looking for now ?"
"My cigarettes ."
"Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin ."
"In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? "
"Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house ."
"But yesterday you said you would rent it ."
"I ’ Ve changed my mind ."
"Why is that ?"
"Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work ."
"Maybe you ’ re right . "
"OK ! Let's get down to business now ."
"Say it ."
"As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series ."
"That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task ."
"I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign ."
"Could you put it in detail ?"
"Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule ."
"I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent ."
"What kind of media do you recommend ?"
"I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it ."
"Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers ."
"I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . "
"My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight ."
"Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant ."
"Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?"
"Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?"
"There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table ."
"The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?"
"You know , that is one of my favorites !"
"OK , I'll take one order of that ."
"You could choose another appetizer for half price to share ."
"Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . "
"Flight BE - 407 to Paris is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge ?"
"Oh , how annoying !"
"The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible ."
"What a nuisance ! "
"Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends ."
"I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday ."
"They spend hours there , especially on weekends ."
"Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?"
"I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?"
"Isn't that complicated ?"
"No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund ."
"We ? Do you want to go with me ?"
"Sure . I love going to the mall ."
"What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? "
"Can I help you , madam ?"
"Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat ."
"Have you any particular color in mind ?"
"I don't know really.What ' s the fashional color this year ?"
"Red is very popular ."
"Good.Red suits me very well.It ' s a cheerful color , isn't it ?"
"Yes , madam , I agree.What size are you ?"
"Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen ."
"Here you are , madam.All these are sixteens ."
"I quite like this one.How much is it ?"
"It's $ 180 ."
"Oh , that's too expensive.Aren ' t there any cheaper ones ?"
"These are our cheapest coats , madam ."
"Yes , I see . I'll take it.Here ' s $ 200 ."
"Here's your change ."
"Thank you . "
"Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ?"
"I can't , I have to go to the gym ."
"Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !"
"Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy ."
"That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?"
"Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats ."
"Sounds like you are really getting in shape ! "
"Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ?"
"Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop . You should be able to find it from there ."
"I ’ m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ?"
"The southbound A trains say Brooklyn ."
"O . K ."
"so it ’ s this one ?"
"Yeah . Hey ? What are you doing ? Let the people off the train before you get on ."
"Oh , sorry ."
"Jeez . Tourists . "
"I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL ."
"What's the problem ?"
"The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged ."
"Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left ."
"But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose ."
"That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling ."
"But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing ."
"But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps ."
"But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken ."
"I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . "
"What do you do ?"
"I ’ m a firefighter ."
"Really ? That ’ s so cool ."
"I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love ."
"What station do you work at ?"
"I work downtown at station 24.It can get a little crazy sometimes but that ’ s what makes it challenging . "
"Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ?"
"Go ahead , please ."
"How long is my paid vacation every year ?"
"You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year ."
"What about the insurance and housing policies ?"
"We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance ."
"How often is the bonus ?"
"You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year ."
"Do I have training opportunities ?"
"We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad ."
"Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer ."
"Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days ."
"Ok , thank you for your time and patience ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five !"
"Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office ."
"Okay . The sooner the better ."
"You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? "
"So am I on the right road to Piccadilly Circus ?"
"I think so , ‘ cause I remember the policeman told me this is the very way ."
"What did he say ?"
"Just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left ."
"That ’ s it . I think we ’ re one block beyond . "
"Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ?"
"I'm going to Disneyland ."
"That sounds like fun ! "
"Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together ."
"This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows ."
"I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales ."
"Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks ."
"That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase ."
"At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . "
"What ’ s the matter , dear ?"
"Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag ."
"Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?"
"No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worried about ."
"You must tell your embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . "
"I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please ."
"Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ?"
"No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today ."
"Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today ."
"Would you please ask when he will be free ?"
"Have a seat please while I call . "
"John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again ."
"I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again ."
"That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside !"
"I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . "
"It's my first time to come to Bangkok . Could you recommend some places for me ?"
"Well , it depends on what you have ."
"What do you mean ?"
"It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city , I don't think you would like to miss it ."
"Sounds persuasive . How much will you charge for it ?"
"50 dollars per person ."
"That's reasonable . Will you take care of meals for the day ?"
"Of course . Please take it easy ."
"I see . May I know the schedule ?"
"Why not ? "
"What kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ?"
"I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money ."
"That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations ."
"Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet ."
"Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ?"
"I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field ."
"Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well ."
"That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? "
"I need to talk to you about something ."
"What did you need to talk about ?"
"I have some questions about my lease ."
"Like what ?"
"Exactly how long is my lease for ?"
"Your lease will be up in three years ."
"What will happen if I move out before then ?"
"If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible ."
"I don ’ t understand ."
"Because our contract says that you will live here for three years ."
"Okay , I think that I understand ."
"I ’ m glad you understand . "
"I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !"
"No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering ."
"Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining ."
"Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?"
"Actually , the factory is located in Scotland ."
"Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... , That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !"
"Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... , Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection ."
"Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?"
"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis ."
"Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?"
"It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . "
"Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ?"
"Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house ."
"Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps ."
"I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well ."
"Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !"
"Do I have to pay an installation fee ?"
"Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !"
"Awesome ! "
"Could you make up this prescription for me , please ?"
"Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock ."
"What can I do ?"
"Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?"
"Could I ?"
"Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise ."
"Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ?"
"This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day ."
"Thank you ."
"You're welcome . "
"We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem ."
"What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well ."
"The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price ."
"$ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer ."
"I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies ."
"You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable ."
"I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away ."
"Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first ."
"All right , we'll wait for your answer . "
"Excuse me . I seem to have lost my son ."
"Take it easy , madam . And speak slowly . May I have your name first ?"
"Shirley ."
"What's your son's name ?"
"Daniel ."
"Can you describe his appearance to me ?"
"He is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes . About 1.4 meters ."
"OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! "
"have you ever been in an earthquake ?"
"yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over ."
"do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ?"
"I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ?"
"no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger ."
"where are you from ?"
"I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes ."
"did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?"
"most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room ."
"wow , that must have really been scary ."
"actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass ."
"have you ever experiences a flood ?"
"no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !"
"that sure didn't last long ! "
"I'd like to order a restock on my minibar ."
"You finished everything in there , sir ?"
"Absolutely everything ."
"What would you like to order ?"
"Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam ."
"Uh-huh . What else do you want ?"
"The apples were great . Could you bring a couple more up ?"
"No problem . Is there anything else I can get for you ?"
"Some grape juice would also be nice ."
"I'll get all of that for you right away . Someone should be up shortly "
"Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ?"
"Is Diana in ?"
"No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ?"
"Yes , please ask her to call John Smith ."
"Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message . "
"Can you type , Jane ?"
"Yes , I can ."
"How many words a minute ?"
"About 100 words a minute ."
"En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ?"
"Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese ."

"... Can you start next week ?"
"Next week ?"
"Yes , on Monday ."
"You mean I have the job ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . "
"I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden !"
"What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening !"
"On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject ."
"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?"
"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools ."
"What type of tools ?"
"You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe ."
"Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?"
"I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !"
"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! "
"May I speak to Peter ?"
"Who's calling ? "
"Have you every belonged to a political party ?"
"No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party ."
"Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it ."
"The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular ."
"You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness , Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully ."
"That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . "
"Look , George , There's the Great Wall ."
"I see . It's on top of the hills ."

"Do we have any choices ?"
"Well , we could take the cable car ."
"Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think ."
"Okay . Let's go ."
"Well , that was tough ."
"But we made it ."
"This looks great . When was it built ?"
"It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago ."
"That's remarkable ."
"There are so many ancient relics in China . "
"Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week ."

"You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year ."
"How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before ."
"Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper ."
"You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . "
"Hello , this is Than Hua's office . Can I help you ?"
"Hello , could I speak to the export manager , please ?"
"Speaking ."
"This is Joey from Mary trading company . I learned that you are the leading export of cloth by Hummed company ."
"That's right . What can I do for you ?"
"We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities . "
"Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design ."

"Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . "
"I hear you jog everyday ."

"I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ?"
"You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 !"
"Last night ?"
"Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ , You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? "

"Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !"

"Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor ."
"Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !"
"Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . "
"Are you going to vote ?"
"I am . Are you ?"
"Yes , and for the first time ."
"Is that right ?"
"I don ’ t know how to vote ."
"Voting isn ’ t difficult ."
"I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on ."
"They tell you everything on the ballot ."
"They do ?"
"You ’ ll be okay ."
"Thanks for telling me ."
"You should be excited about your first vote . "
"Do you like cooking ?"
"I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ?"
"I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away ."
"You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes ."
"So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food ."
"Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice ."
"Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?"
"Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients ."
"How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ?"
"Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours . "
"Can I help you , sir ?"
"Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks ."
"All right . How much do you need ?"
"One thousand U . S . dollars ."
"One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ?"
"Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account ."
"All right . Now can I have your passbook ?"
"Right . Here it is ."
"Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ?"
"Mm . In hundreds , please . "
"Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room ."
"Yes.If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available ."
"How much are you asking ?"
"800 yuan a month ."
"Could I have a look at it , please ?"
"Sorry , but I'm on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? "
"Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ?"
"He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ... , It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik ."
"Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki ."
"How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ?"
"She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on ."
"Right . Cool ! Let's go ! "
"I really don ’ t know how to teach my son . He's getting far above himself ."
"You should send him to the boarding school . He need a strict teacher ."
"Maybe you are right . I will discuss it with my wife tonight . "
"Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items ."
"Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ?"
"Sure . Do you have a minute ? Why don't you have a seat and let me show you how to operate this item ?"
"OK . Go ahead ."
"You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella ."
"How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ?"
"It only costs you 20 dollars for one ."
"OK , I will take one . "
"Cindy , can you show me how to call Connecticut ?"
"Who do you know there ?"
"A good friend of mine is there on a homestay program , too ."
"I see ."
"Is it expensive to make out-of-state calls ?"
"Yeah , but it isn't more expensive than international calls ."
"What do I do here ?"
"Easy . Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number ."
"That's it ?"
"Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident . "
"Which university did you graduate from ?"
"I graduated from Peking University ."
"What was your major at university ?"
"I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China ."
"What course did you like best ?"
"I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work ."
"What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?"
"I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . "
"I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out ."
"You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering ."
"I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer ."
"Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability ."
"I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer ."
"You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence ."
"Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners ."
"In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded ."
"Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ?"
"Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath ."
"I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me ."
"You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so ."
"I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . "
"Good afternoon , ABC Incorporated . How many I direct your call ?"
"I would like to speak to Mr . Miles ."
"I am sorry , sir . He isn't in right now . Would you like to leave a message ?"
"Yes . Can you tell him Bob White called ?"
"And your company name , please ."
"He knows who I am ."
"Is there a telephone number where you can be reached ?"
"I can be reached at 544-879-9087 until 5 p . m . today ."
"Thank you , sir . I'll tell him you called ."
"Thank you . "
"Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card ."
"Thank you very much ."
"I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company ."
"I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job ."
"Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ?"
"I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system ."
"How do you work with a team ?"
"I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members ."
"What ’ s your long term goal ?"
"I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans . "
"Excuse me , sir , your steamed crabs is coming ."
"It looks delicious . Can you tell me how to enjoy it ? It's my first time to eat it ."
"Mix a little soya sauce , vinegar and sliced ginger on this plate and dip the meat in it before eating ."
"Thanks a lot . "
"Good afternoon , can I help you ?"
"Good afternoon . I need some stamps and envelopes ."
"How many and what kind ?"
"A dozen 30 - cent stamps and 6 envelopes ."
"Anything else ?"
"That ’ s all . How much altogether ?"
"$ 16 . 50 ."
"Thank you very much ."
"You are welcome . "
"Do you like travelling ?"
"Yes , I do ."
"Do you usually travel by bus ?"
"No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . "
"You look like in perfect condition ."
"I go to the gym every day to keep fit ."
"Which sports do you participate in ?"
"I've been doing yoga for a long time ."
"Can you tell me something about yoga ?"
"Yoga is used to promote people's physical , intellectual and mental harmony and healthy ."
"How do you feel when you practice yoga ?"
"Oh , I feel really tired and sweat a lot ."
"But it will help you keep fit ."
"Sure . But more importantly , I can have peace of mind . "
"Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir ."
"Thank you . It looks very attractive ."
"I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot ."
"Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes ."
"Yes . It's a traditional dish ."
"And it must be very particular in cooking ."
"You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour ."
"I see ."
"Enjoy yourself , sir . "
"Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it ."
"It is called Energy Collector ."
"Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ?"
"Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it.It was very exciting ."
"I want to have a try later ."
"Me , too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ?"
"Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky ."
"Good , you can make your dream come true here ."
"Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House ."
"So you can prove you are a man ."
"Bingo !"
"It's just you ! "
"morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams ."
"Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ?"
"Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know !"
"Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . "
"Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ?"
"Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it ."
"I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ?"
"Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ?"
"Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department ."
"OK , thank you . "
"Should I tell EDD that I have found a job ?"
"Is this a temporary job or something more permanent ?"
"What difference does it make ?"
"When you get your next Continued Claim Form , you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment ."
"If I take a short job and then get laid off , will I be starting over trying to get unemployment ?"
"Just because you work for a week doesn ’ t mean that you will be losing your benefits . "
"We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment ."
"I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by ."
"We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found ."
"What problems did you find ?"
"The roof leaks when it rains , there is mold on the bedroom walls , and the dishwasher doesn ’ t work ."
"I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself ."
"Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility ."
"I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky !"
"Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday ."
"You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! "
"Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma ."
"Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here ."
"She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all ."
"I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us ."
"You know , maybe she's just a neat freak ."
"I think she just likes to make us miserable ."
"You could be right . "
"Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter ."
"I think so , but how should we write it ?"
"I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal ."
"Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement ."
"We should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job ."
"We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job ."
"For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish ."
"Oh , you have recommended yourself very well . I should think about how to recommend myself as well ."
"You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English ."
"Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings ."
"Let's write it at once . "
"Hello . Good morning , Stately Restaurant . May I help you ?"
"I would like to book a table for seven thirty o'clock , please ."
"Fine , sir . For how many people , please ?"
"For four people . We'd like a quiet table with a fine view of the river ."
"OK . What name , please ?"
"This is Peter Kaufman ."
"Can you spell that , please ?"
"Peter Kaufman , P-E-T-E-R ( Peter ) , K-A-U-F-M-A-N ( Kaufman ) ."
"Oh , thanks , Mr . Kaufman . We look forward to your visit ."
"Bye-bye . "
"Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ?"
"Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do ."
"Are you sure ?"
"Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body ."
"Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ?"
"It could also help you increase vital capacity ."
"That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight ."
"You will make it if you persist in it . "
"Gucci , you look serious . I wish you ’ d let your hair down ."
"Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed . "
"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday ."
"What words ? Can you tell me ?"
"He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that ."
"Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason ."
"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable ."
"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc ."
"please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness ."
"It ’ s easy to say , but I will try ."
"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire ."
"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . "
"How much for these autographed Elvis records ?"
"Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks ."
"Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ?"
"Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks ."
"I don't really need five ."
"OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer ."
"Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . "
"Hi , what brings you to my office today ?"
"I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out ."
"Have you had the flu lately ?"
"No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath ."
"Have you ever been tested for allergies ?"
"Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies ."
"Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ?"
"I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week ."
"I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma ."
"I appreciate the referral , doctor . "
"How are the children doing in your class , Jane ?"
"They ’ re all doing fine . Let me show you some of their pictures ."
"Which child is this ?"
"That ’ s Charles ."
"What a large child !"
"All my children are large ."
"And which child is this ?"
"That ’ s James ."
"What an agile child !"
"All my children are agile ."
"Now which child is this ?"
"That ’ s Joanna . Joanna hopes to go to college ."
"Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ? "
"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?"
"Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher ."
"Oh , what ’ s she like ?"
"She is beautiful ."
"Is she old or young ?"
"She is quite young and her hair is blond ."
"Is she strict ?"
"Not really . Her eyes are blue ."
"Can she speak Chinese ?"
"Not much . She is very tall and slim ."
"David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . "
"Good afternoon , sir ."
"Good afternoon . I have a reservation under the name of Hilton ."
"Could you spell that , please ?"
"Sure . It's H-I-L-T-O-N ."
"One moment , please . Ah yes , Mr . Hilton , you booked a single room for three nights . Is that correct ?"
"Yes , that's right ."
"I see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . Do you have your loyalty card ?"
"Yes , here you are . And here's my credit card , too ."
"Thank you . Right , your room number is 105 . Here's your key and receipt . Thank you for choosing our hotel again , sir ."
"Thank you , goodbye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Could I ask you where the company is ?"
"Sure . Our company is in Ericsson Tower , No . 12 Like East Street , Chaoyang District ."
"Can I get there by the No . 913 bus ?"
"You can make it by the No . 913 bus , or by subway Line 13 . "
"Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ?"
"Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . "
"May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ?"
"Here you are ."
"Will you please put all your luggage on the scale ?"
"I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself ."
"Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage ."
"Well , then , how much do I owe you ?"
"That comes to H . K . $ 120 . "
"Hello , can I help you ?"
"Yes . I ’ m looking for something to wear to a formal party ."
"What dress size do you wear ?"
"Medium , a woman ’ s size 10 or 12 ."
"This dress is the latest fashion form Paris . It ’ s made of pure silk . And this silk blouse would go with this skirt . Do you like it ?"
"Yes ."
"Why don ’ t you try it on and see how you feel about it ?"
"That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on ."
"How does that feel ?"
"It feels very good ."
"You look wonderful ."
"Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out ."
"I think that looks like a very nice house . Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses ?"
"Yes , I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet ."
"I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway !"
"We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here ."
"That works for me . We can check out the kitchen next ."
"On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers ."
"Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it ."
"What is the price of this house in the flyer ?"
"They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market . It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand . "
"Would you like to have a piece of cake ?"
"No , thank you . I'm on a diet ."
"Why ? You're not fat ."
"I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure ."
"Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident ."
"I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only ."
"Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties ."
"How much do they weigh ?"
"All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg ."
"But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . "
"We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ?"
"As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment ."
"Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ?"
"Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation ."
"I see . Why not use wooden cases ?"
"If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking ."
"Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ?"
"Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes ."
"Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers ."
"That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping ."
"Sounds good . "
"Personnel . May I help you ?"
"Hi , could I speak to Nancy please ?"
"This is she . Paul ?"
"Yeah , it ’ s me . Can you give me a lift after work ? "
"I was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to Taiwan ."
"I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble ."
"I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping ."
"Maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid ."
"Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ?"
"Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . "
"Hi , is this Sue ?"
"Yes ?"
"Sue , this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm ."
"What position ?"
"Senior account rep ."
"How much does it pay ?"
"It starts at $ 30,000 . S , I'm sorry but my bottom figure is $ 36,000 . "
"How can I help you this afternoon ?"
"I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter ."
"Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up ."
"Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon ."
"You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ?"
"I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card ."
"Thank you . And you require ... , 800 RIB , please ."
"Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please ."
"OK ... , Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me ."
"Yes , that's great . Thanks . "
"Can I help you ?"
"Yes.Do you have football stockings here ?"
"Yes.There are two colors ."
"OK , I'll buy two pairs of each color.And do you have sports socks ?"
"Yes ."
"OK , give me two pairs in white ."
"Anything else ?"
"No.That ' s all . "
"Would you please take a seat over there , madam ? I ’ ll let Mr . Emory know that you ’ re here ."
"Thanks . I can wait here ."
"Well , it may take some time . Mr . Emory ’ s at a meeting at the moment . It would probably be more comfortable over there ."
"I see . All right , then . Thanks . "
"I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen ."
"high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room ."
"It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood ."
"What about the one on the Yellow River Road ?"
"It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen ."
"It's a bit small but looks nice ."
"What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . "
"Can I see your ticket please ?"
"Here you are ."
"Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ?"
"Just this one ."
"And would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ?"
"Aisle , please ."
"Boarding time is 10:20 am ."
"What's the gate number ?"
"Gate 29C . Have a nice flight . "
"Hi ! May I help you ?"
"Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation ."
"In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions ."
"No wonder ."
"Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company ."
"Thank you ! "
"Hey honey ! Where were you ?"
"I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air ."
"How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ?"
"It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit ."
"Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox ."
"Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted !"
"You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! "
"Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ?"
"I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me ."
"Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too ."
"Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ?"
"Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ?"
"That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons ."
"The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca ."
"I hope to hear from you very soon ."
"Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . "
"I want to go house shopping , and I want to know what I can afford to buy ."
"There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ?"
"I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year ."
"What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ?"
"I have been at the job I now have for 2 years , and I have been with the company for 6 years total ."
"Do you receive any other income ?"
"I own a small rental unit with a partner , and I receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit ."
"Do you know what your credit score is ?"
"I don ’ t know , but the last time I checked , it was very good !"
"You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more ! "
"My baggage is missing !"
"Do you have air ticket and claim tag ?"
"Here they are ."
"Well , then , would you fill out this PIR from ? And also we need your signature here ."
"How soon would you deliver my baggage ?"
"Hopefully by tomorrow evening.Which hotel are you going to stay ?"
"At the down town Hilton Hotel ."
"When is the expected date of your departure ?"
"I'm going to return next week . "
"You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !"
"Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant ."
"They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day ."
"They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . "
"Good morning ."
"Good morning ."
"This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?"
"I ’ m sorry.She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nine.Can I take a message for her ?"
"Thank you.But I will call her later ."
"OK.Goodbye ."
"Goodbye . "
"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?"
"Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job ."
"Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?"
"I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out ."

"Okay , what time is my meeting in London ?"

"Who is Ms Von ?"

"OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . "
"What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ?"
"We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur ."
"What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ?"
"It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets ."
"For example ?"
"For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . "

"Should I expect any side effects ?"
"Sometimes you might feel dizzy , but that isn ’ t common . "
"That restaurant has six parking spaces ."
"What are the odds of finding a parking space there ?"
"Almost zero . "
"Good morning , how are you doing today ?"
"I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith ."
"So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical ."
"Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam ."

"In a cushioned sleeper , please . "

"Yeah . They were just sent over to your office . You should have them in about half an hour ."
"Thanks a lot . Sorry to trouble you . "

"Hello again . What can I do for you today ?"
"Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents ."
"Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ?"
"That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ?"
"Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... , Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee ."
"The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars ."
"That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . "
"Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ’ m very impressed ."
"Thank you ."

"Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years ."
"Oh , did he ?"
"Yes , but he retired 5 years ago ."
"Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ?"
"I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally ."

"Thanks . It was very nice to meet you ."
"It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today . "
"Is Tom in ?"
"Wrong number ."
"Isn't this Li's residence ?"
"No , it is not ."
"Oh , I'm sorry . "
"Hello . Is everything OK , there ?"
"I'm having a little trouble with this form ."
"What seems to be the problem ?"
"There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want ."
"That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular ."
"So , I should choose that one ?"
"I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form ."
"I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ?"
"Yes , that's all in order . Let's get this processed for you , then . "
"You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts ."
"I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . "
"Jack ! You've really done it this time ."
"What ? What happened ?"
"I told you to get this consignment out last week.We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ?"
"Please , give me one more chance . I'll never let it happen again . I'm very sorry ."
"Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ?"
"Um , me ?"
"Bingo ! "
"Could you tell me your education background ?"
"Sure . Where shall I begin ?"
"Where did you go to university ?"
"I went to the university of Ohio , in America ."
"What degree did you get ?"
"I got a bachelor ’ s degree ."
"What was your major ?"
"I majored in English and minored in Chinese ."
"What was you G . P . A ?"
"I graduated with honors ; I had a 3.9 ."

"When do you think you will do that ?"
"After I have 3-4 years of work experience ."
"I see . "
"I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem ."
"I should say it is something we have never come across before ."
"The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers ."
"In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports ."
"Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States ."
"Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ?"
"I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs ."
"In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ?"
"Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations ."
"Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . "
"There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight ."
"Do you know which channel it is on ?"
"Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms ."
"I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ?"
"We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for ."
"It's not that serious ."
"Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ?"
"You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you . "
"We are very interested in your printed pure silk scarves , so could you introduce us your prices ?"
"Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply ."
"Please send us your best offer and state payment terms and time of shipment ."
"Ok . I need to discuss it with our manager . We'll let you have our firm offer next week ."
"I'm waiting . Your early offer will be highly appreciated ."
"Ok . I will reply to you as soon as possible . "
"Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ?"
"Yes , ma ’ am . How may I help you ?"
"I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ?"
"Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ’ am . "
"You look very professional in the suit ."
"The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable ."
"I appreciate it . It is related to company image . "
"I want a suit of workmanship and suitable for formal meetings.Would you recommend some brands ?"
"How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... , I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my means ."
"Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . "
"Thank you for bringing me here . What shall we order ?"
"Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ?"
"Really ? I ’ d rather have the chicken feet to be honest ."
"Ok then , let ’ s get the chicken feet ."
"How about drinks ? Would you like beer or wine ?"
"I ’ d prefer wine . You ?"
"Wine ’ s fine by me . Let ’ s order a bottle of the house red then ."
"Ok , a bottle of the house red please ! "
"Hi , I have a reservation for flight 007 to New York ."
"May I see your ticket and photo ID ?"
"Yes , here's my ticket and my driver's license ."
"Are these your bags ?"
"Yes , they are ."
"Have you been asked to carry anything for a stranger ?"
"No ."
"Have you maintained full control of your possessions while in the airport ?"
"Yes , I have . "
"Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report ."
"How is the new product ?"
"30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing ."
"Yes , I think so . And how about the price ?"
"Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little ."
"Yes , I agree with you . We should add our opinions to the research report ."
"Absolutely . "
"Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant ."
"Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ?"
"I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce ."
"What was your major at college ?"
"My major was accounting ."
"Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ?"

"What kind of work are you doing now ?"
"I'm engaged in accounting ."
"What are your responsibilities in your present work ?"
"My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency ."
"Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ?"
"I think so ."
"Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ?"
"Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 ."
"What's the creditor's equity ?"
"The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . "
"Will you tell me the situation ?"
"I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so ."
"And then ?"
"I came back to my room and found that my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone ."
"I'm afraid you must give up the cash.Are you insured ?"
"Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card ."
"I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . "
"Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ?"
"Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter ."
"They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working ."
"All these say a lot for their characters ."
"So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . "
"Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with ."
"Which train is the ticket for ?"
"It is Train No . 249 . It will depart in four hours ."
"It is not too late . Pass your ticket to me , please ."
"How much is the cancellation fee ?"
"Five Yuan ."
"Thanks . "
"Joe , can you squeeze me in sometime today ?"
"That's a big order , Jane . I am really swamped ."
"I know what you're saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy ."
"Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? "
"National Trust ."
"My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet ."
"Just one second , and I'll check ."
"Thank you . "
"Hello !"
"Hello , Debbie . This is Donald ."
"Oh , hi , Donald ."
"What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ’ t you ?"
"Well , it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold , so I decided to stay home ."
"You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered ."
"Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday ."
"What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ?"
"No , they stayed home and played cards with the children ."
"And what did you do ? Did you play cards , too ?"
"No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ?"
"I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! "
"Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ?"
"I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied ."
"I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ?"
"Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation ."
"Why do you plan to change your job ?"
"Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough ."
"Have you applied for work with any other companies ?"
"Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed ."
"If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ?"
"This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . "
"Miss , where do you want to go ?"
"Could you drop me off at the airport ?"
"No problem ."
"Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ?"
"Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece ."
"All right . "
"Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ?"
"Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ?"
"Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans ."

"Have you received any degrees ?"
"Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University ."
"How about your academic records at college ?"
"In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class ."
"That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ?"
"English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it ."
"Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ?"
"Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it . I also performed well in the subjects . Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position ."
"Did you get any honors and awards at college ?"
"Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize . "
"Do you have any other questions ?"
"Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ?"
"According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months ."
"What is the salary while on probation ?"
"In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month ."
"That sounds fine ."
"The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance ."
"Are there paid holidays ?"
"Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year . "
"Miss , the air-conditioner in my room doesn't work ."
"Oh , sorry about that.We ' ll get it fixed as soon as we can . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I'm looking for books on WTO.Could you show me where they are ?"
"Come this way please.We ' Ve got plenty of them and they're all on the shelf near the cashier's desk ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"You're welcome . "
"Can I help you ?"
"I'm looking for an MP - 3 player . Which brand is of the highest quality ?"
"I recommend Pioneer ."
"Which model is the best-seller ?"
"This model is very popular with ladies ."
"May I have a look at it ?"
"Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings ."
"Do you have this model in white ?"
"No , but we have it in yellow ."
"Then I'll take the yellow one ."
"Please wait a second . I'll get it for you ."
"Okay . "
"Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?"
"I bought it online ."
"Really ? Do you often shop online ?"
"Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online ."
"I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?"
"Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home ."
"Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier ."
"And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall ."
"Well , are there any other advantages ?"
"Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere ."
"Are there many choices of online shopping ?"
"Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of ."
"Perhaps I should have a try . "
"Come in , young man ."
"( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir ."
"I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son ."
"Thank you . Have you received my resume ?"
"Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ?"
"Of course , here you are , sir ."
"Call me Mr . Smith ."
"Certainly , Mr . Smith . "
"How good is your Mandarin ?"
"Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child . So I can speak it very fluently ."
"What dialect do you understand ?"
"I can speak and read Cantonese because I worked in Guangdong for many years . "
"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ?"
"I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life ."
"You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art ."
"An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating ."
"Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ?"
"I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels ."
"All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life ."
"I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements ."
"Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life ."
"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ?"
"Indeed , you're exactly right ! "
"Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ?"
"Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible ."
"Should we use the stairs ?"
"Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . "
"Excuse me , I'd like to try some Chinese food ."
"We serve excellent Chinese food . Which style do you prefer ?"
"I know nothing about Chinese food . Could you give me some suggestions ?"
"It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food , Shandong food , Sichuan food etc ."
"Is there any difference ?"
"Yes , Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy ."
"How about Sichuan food ?"
"Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot . They taste differently ."
"Oh , really . I like hot food . So what is your recommendation for me ?"
"I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious . We have a Sichuan food dining room . May I suggest you to go there ? It's on the third floor ."
"Thank you ."
"It's my pleasure . "
"Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ?"
"Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks ."
"Is it far from here ?"
"No , it ’ s only ten-minute's walk ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"You ’ re welcome . "
"May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail ."
"Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . "
"Steven , what's the expense of moving house ?"
"About 3 000 dollars ."
"It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ?"
"I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting ."
"We have to cut back on our shopping from now on ."
"Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income ."
"I hope so . "
"We are sorry to bring you so much trouble ."
"We hope that this dispute can be settled through friendly negotiation without its being submitted for arbitration ."
"Yes . That's what we want . "
"How do I submit an expense report ?"
"You need all your receipts for reimbursement ."
"You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?"
"Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . "
"Are you ready to order ?"
"Yes . I'll have the fresh fruit cocktail ."
"And for your entree ?"
"I think I'll Ty the crisp deep-fried chicken . "
"Hello . Can I ask what steps I have to go through in applying for the job ?"
"It is not very complicated . You can send your resume to the e-mail address of our company ."
"What is the next step ?"
"Our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive , select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them . "
"Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in ."
"Where else haven't I been to yet ?"
"Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls !"
"Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ?"
"Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections ."
"Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense !"
"No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ."
"Enough , David ! I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now !"
"Okey , Okey . We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there ."
"Very interesting . That's really a place I must go and see . And then ?"
"If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures ."
"Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . "
"Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it ."
"You do ? OK , fine with me ."
"Thank you so much ."
"But I also want ya to do me a favor ."
"What ?"
"You gotta have some better deodorant ."
"I ’ m sorry ? ! "
"No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job ."
"With invoking ? No , thanks ."
"I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building ."
"I'm not interested , Zina ."
"Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again ."
"I don't think so ."
"Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . "
"What do we need for the barbecue ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties ."
"I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ?"
"I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up ."
"And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers ."
"They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes ."
"I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce ."
"I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop ."
"How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ?"
"It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked ."
"They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it ."
"I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . "
"During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad ."
"If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same ."
"If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ?"
"The insurance policy protects us ."
"Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ?"
"It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . "
"I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ?"
"Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ?"
"That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 , That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel . "
"Excuse me , What time does the next bus for Boston leave ?"
"It leaves at 8 , I see . Are there any seat available ?"
"Just a moment please . Yes . You can have a seat ."
"Good . How much is it when we take it ?"
"It thirty-eight dollars ."
"All right . Here ‘ s forty dollars ."
"Here ’ s your ticket and change ."
"Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ?"
"Go to gate No . 2 please ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Don ’ t mention it . "
"Telco Mobile , how can I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please ."
"Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling ."
"Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ?"
"Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate ."
"Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number ."
"Yes of course . We can activate all these services in about an hour . "
"I need to copy a document immediately ."
"We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor ."
"Great ! How much is it for a copy ?"
"The price per copy is ten cents ."
"That sounds reasonable . I'll be down there immediately ."
"There shouldn't be any long lines , sir . "
"( At the MET station ) Hurry up ! We are running late for school ."
"Let's take the MET . lt's faster and cheap ."
"Which line should we take if we go to Danshui ?"
"We should take the red line . Let's get the tickets at the automatic vending Machine ."
"How much money should I insert in the slot ?"
"5o dollars . Later you have to place your ticket near the sensor ."
"I see ."
"It's so crowded . All the seats are taken . Let's go there . There is a seat over there ."
"It's a priority seat . We can not sit there . We should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people ."
"Yeah , you are right . Let's stand . It takes only about 20 minutes ."
"If we go to Danshui in the morning on A weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour ."
"Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset . "
"Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ?"
"Yes . There are trains at 7:59 , 9:18 , and 10:32 ."
"What time does the 7:59 train get to London ?"
"At 9:36 ."
"What about coming back ? I'd like to come back at about 7 p . m ."
"There's one at 7:10 p . m . and the next one is at 7:40 p . m ."
"Mmm , how much is a return ticket ?"
"If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m ."
"there is a saver return which is 9 pounds . An ordinary return is 16 pounds ."
"An ordinary return , please . "
"After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left ."
"Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . "
"Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ?"
"No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man ."
"I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald ."
"That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . "
"Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline ."
"I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like ."
"I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon ."
"Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . "
"Good morning , Mr.Robinson . I am afraid there is a change in today's program . I just got word that your appointment with Mr . Smith , the general manager of Western Textile Co ."
"Ltd ."
"will have to be put off ."
"But why ?"
"Mr.Smith called just now that he had to fly to Shanghai on urgent business today ."
"OK , I see ."
"Mr.Smith is sending his apologies and has asked me to find out if the day after tomorrow would be all right with you ."
"Yes , that will be just as good ."
"Then shall we make it nine o'clock the day after tomorrow morning ?"
"All right . Then I can do some shopping today before going back to my country . "
"Morning . May I help you ?"
"Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily ."
"Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge ."
"How much is the service charge ?"
"One percent ."
"Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ?"
"More than enough . Please fill in this form ."
"Anything else ?"
"Your passport , please . "
"Have you ever shopped online ?"
"Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time ."
"Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try ."
"You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time ."
"What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?"
"Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that ."
"It is so nice of you . "
"May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?"
"Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point ."
"Thank you for telling me that ."
"But remind you , there are some forbidden activities ."
"What are they ? I ’ ll be careful ."
"Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters ."
"I got it ."
"Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed ."
"I see . "
"Hello , this is Mary from the Taipei new station , what can i do for you ?"
"Hello , Marry , this is Lin Wang , calling from network ."
"Hi , Mr Wang , who do you wish to speak to ?"
"May i speak to David please ?"
"Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office ."
"Oh , sorry , David Richton ."
"Please hold on a minute , offer your call to Mr Richton ."
"Thank you ."
"You are welcome . "
"Dad , can you help me ?"
"Oh , honey , you made a mistake ."
"I don't know how to do it ."
"OK . Let's do it together ."
"16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ?"
"16 divided by 2 equals 8 ."
"You got it . Good job . "
"Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ?"
"No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition ."
"Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ?"
"Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago ."
"We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers ."
"Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?"
"First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves ."
"I see . What else ?"
"We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones ."
"Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money ."
"Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . "
"Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ?"
"Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month ."
"Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks ."
"Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ?"
"Can you recommend some must-try ?"
"OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao ."
"What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny !"
"Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun ."
"Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert ."
"Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings ."
"I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ?"
"Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! "
"Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ?"
"You ’ re right ."
"Look ! The iron is still on ."
"I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now ."
"Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it ."
"I ’ m sorry , Jim ."
"Never mind , dear . "
"Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ?"
"Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 ."
"553-2213 . Great , thanks ."
"No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . "
"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started !"
"Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color ."
"Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich ."
"Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil ."
"Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt !"
"That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! "
"Can you tell me where the supply shop is ?"
"Sure . It ’ s on basement level one . Turn right when you get off the elevator ."
"Great ! Thanks a lot !"
"No problem , John . "
"What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ?"
"I'll have to check . Do you need anything else ?"
"Yes . Five one-dollar stamps , please ."
"That'll be 14 dollars in all . "
"Is there any chance to further study ?"
"Nope . Our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . We don't think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making ."
"Do you have training program or plan for employees ?"
"Nope . We just hope our employees will make profit for us . "
"You look tired ."
"Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately ."
"Really ? How come ?"
"My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult !"
"You shouldn ’ t work so hard ."
"I know . But hard work pays off , you know ."
"What do you mean ?"
"Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . "
"My dear , it's five flights up !"
"That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us ."
"Is the place well-furnished ?"
"Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play ."
"What about the kitchen ?"
"The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires ."
"Are the plumbing all right ?"
"The plumbing seems OK , too.The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water , and the sinks don't seem to leak ."
"The place is OK.Let ' s go there and have a look at it again . "
"Hello , what can I do for you today ?"
"Well , I ’ Ve got a terrible stomach-ache and I keep needing the toilet ."
"I see . Well , with those symptoms maybe you ’ Ve got food poisoning . What have you eaten recently ?"
"Well , I went to a seafood restaurant last night and I ate lots of oysters ."
"Hmm . It may be those then , especially if they were raw . Well , I ’ ll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow ."
"Ok . Thank you very much . "
"Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ?"
"Yes . My name's Mark Benson . I just started a couple weeks ago ."
"Well , if there's anything I can do for you , let me know ."
"Thanks , I appreciate that ! "
"I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month ."
"It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves ."
"Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible ."
"Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . "
"Excuse me , I'm looking for your English textbooks ."
"They're right over there , next to the dictionaries ."
"Do you have any textbooks to help improve students ' reading skills ?"
"Let ' s see . These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about ."
"Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . "
"Excuse me . I want to pay the bill ."
"Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan ."
"Here you are ."
"Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ?"
"No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance ."
"In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed ."
"Thanks a lot ."
"Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . "
"Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends ."
"He is the guy I was telling you about . "
"Here we come ."
"Thank you.What ' s the fare ?"
"$ 10 ."
"How can it be ?"
"Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters ."
"I see . Thanks for your drive . "
"Show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . I am not that fat , you see ."
"You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ?"
"I have no idea . Measure me , please ."
"OK ! 2 Chi round . Try this one . Maybe it's of your size ."
"( After trying ) I'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach ."
"Let me check the stock . How about this one ?"
"( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ?"
"150 Yuan ."
"A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan ."
"Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . "
"Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ?"
"I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then ."
"Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you ."
"How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ?"
"I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 ."
"That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood ."
"It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . "
"I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off ."
"I apologize . This should not have to be this way ."
"Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time ."
"Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . "
"May I help you find something , sir ?"
"I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too ."
"We have all shapes , sizes , qualities and price ranges , do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond ?"
"I think so . Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color ."
"You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted ."
"Well , my price range is a 5,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars , I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band ."
"You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . "
"I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ?"
"What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape ."
"What about the cotton one ?"
"Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . "
"Excuse me , Mr ."
"Macmillan ? Could you tell me the fax number for Mr . Winthrop ’ s office , please ?"
"Sure . I have it right here . 232-2453 . If that one doesn ’ t work , try 232-2456 ."
"Okay – that ’ s 232-2453 , or 232-2456 ."
"That ’ s right . "
"Good morning , Passport , please ."
"Here you are ."
"Ah , thank you . Please bring your luggage here for inspection ."
"Ok . But is there anything wrong ?"
"It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?"
"I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne . Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift ."
"Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free . You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one ."
"Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?"
"Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are . Take this and pay to the woman over there ."
"I've paid for it . Here's the receipt ."
"Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America ."
"Thank you . "
"Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?"
"I'm due to check out tomorrow , but I'd like to extend my stay by two days ."
"Could I have your name and room number ?"
"Tom Black in Room 207 ."
"Please wait a moment , Mr . Black . I'll have to check the reservation records ... I'm sorry , but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today . They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor ."
"What can be done then ?"
"If you don't mind transferring to another room , we may manage it for you . We usually have cancellations or no-shows ."
"That's quite all right . Thank you ."
"It's my pleasure . "
"I'd like to reserve a table for two , please ."
"For what time , sir ?"
"Around 8: 30 p . m ."
"May I have your name please , sir ?"
"Yes , Anthony Fox ."
"Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . "
"I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something ."
"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?"
"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just , is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets , but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?"
"of course , that's something really irritation . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb "
"Sam , you ’ Ve got to forgive me ."
"Forgive you for what ?"
"I used your computer . And I ’ m afraid I ’ Ve erased your personal files accidentally ."
"No ! Are you kidding me ?"
"I ’ m afraid not . I apologize ."
"I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter ."
"I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ?"
"Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! "
"Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ?"
"Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time ."
"I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production ."
"We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill ."
"Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ?"
"I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise ."
"All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September ."
"Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email ."
"That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ?"
"We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request ."
"I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account ."
"Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them ."
"Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ?"
"Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like ."
"Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction ."
"All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . "
"I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers ."
"As a rule , we don't allow any discount ."
"But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know ."
"That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . "
"Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career . So first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . Now let's invite Mr . Simpson to give us his speech ."
"I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration ."
"Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again . "
"Hi ! Can I help you ?"
"Yes . We have reservations ."
"What's your name , sir ?"
"Jack Bates ."
"Yes , sir . We have your reservation . Could you fill out these forms , please ?"
"The reservation was for a double for three nights , wasn't it ?"
"Yes , sir . That's correct . How will you pay your bill , cash or credit card ?"
"Credit card ."
"Thank you , sir . You'll be staying in room 1910 . Here are your keys . The bellhop will take your luggage upstairs . Have a nice stay , sir ."
"Thanks . "
"Good coming ! Welcome to J P Interior Design ."
"Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design ."
"Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ?"
"Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen ."
"Do you prefer some specific style ?"
"Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design ."
"What kind of color tones do you like ?"
"Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright ."
"I see . And what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen ?"
"I'd like it to look simple , neat and relaxing ."
"Fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it ."
"No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ?"
"Okay . Would you please leave your address and phone number ?"
"Of course . This is my card . See you then . "
"The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !"
"Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up ."
"That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !"
"Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded ."
"I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . "

"I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much ."
"And I'll stick with real coffee . "
"Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house !"
"It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside ."
"It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place ."
"You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit ."
"There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy ."

"Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !"
"A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive !"
"The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !"
"Great play !"
"We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone !"
"Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! "
"Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ?"
"Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side ."
"I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers ."
"I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price ."
"What's your proposal then ?"
"I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % ."
"We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ?"
"As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time ."
"5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction ."
"That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that ."
"What's your counter-offer then ?"
"To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help ."
"15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit ."
"If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs ."
"How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction ."
"8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial ."
"Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further ."
"Ok . Let's call it a deal . "
"Roger ? I need figures for accounting . Have finished the calculations ?"
"I ’ m just finishing now , ma ’ am . I ’ ll have them ready within the hour ."
"All right , thanks ."
"You ’ re welcome , ma ’ am . I ’ ll call you when they ’ re ready . "
"Thanks for your help ."
"No problem . "
"There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask ."
"You know that I have no secrets toward you ."
"When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ?"
"Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . "
"Is Betty Sue in her office ?"
"I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now ."
"I see ."
"Can I give her a message for you ?"
"Yes , please tell her I stopped by ."
"And your name , please ?"
"Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ?"
"Certainly . "
"Good evening ."
"Good evening . Could you let us have a double room ?"
"How long will you be staying ?"
"A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street ."
"Let me see . Yes , you can have Room 313 . It's at the back ."
"What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ?"
"20 pounds per day , including breakfast ."
"All right , we'll take it ."
"Very good , sir . Will you register , please ?"
"OK ."
"Thank you . The porter will show you to your room "
"Sally , do you really need to go ?"
"Yeah.It ' s a must for me ."
"But don't forget to give me a ring ."
"I won't , mum . "
"What do you want to know about me ?"
"How about your academic records at college ?"
"The average grade of all my courses is above 85 ."
"In which subject did you get the highest marks ?"
"In mathematics I got a 98 ."
"Have you received any scholarships ?"
"Yes , I have , and three times in total ."
"Have you been a class leader ?"
"I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years ."
"Did you join in any club activities ?"
"I was an aerobics team member in college ."
"What sport are you good at ?"
"I am good at sprint and table tennis ."
"You are excellent . "
"What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ?"
"Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high ."
"So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?"
"No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs ."
"How can a business maximise revenues ?"
"You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small ."
"What else do you suggest ?"
"Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th "
"Excuse me ."
"Yes ? How can I help you ?"
"Are these drinks on sale this weekend ?"
"Yes ."
"Can I buy more than one case ?"
"Yes . The limit is four per family ."
"Okay , I ’ ll take four , please . You saved me a lot ."
"I know . This is a really good bargain ."
"Thanks ."
"No problem . "
"I am so excited !"
"Excited about what ?"
"I just voted ."
"Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ?"
"Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year ."
"That ’ s lucky ."
"Why is that ?"
"You turned 18 in an election year ."
"I didn ’ t think about it like that ."
"Really ?"
"No , but that makes me even more excited ."
"You ’ re a part of history . "
"Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms ."
"I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents ."
"I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ?"
"I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C ."
"But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem ."
"I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . "
"Can I get some medicine to help me ?"
"For your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications ."
"What types of drugs can I try ?"
"Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention ."
"What about side effects from that medication ?"
"Most people have no side effects . You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication ."
"Do I only need to take that one drug ?"
"I am going to add a second drug for now , Lisinopril , which is an ACE inhibitor ."
"What can I expect when I take that medication ?"
"You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough . "
"Are you watching another news report about the war ?"
"Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded ."
"How did this war start ?"
"Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other ."
"Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise ."
"Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down ."
"What do you think will happen ?"
"Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate ."
"It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . "
"Mr . Wilson . We very regret the mistakes in goods . I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake ."
"We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained ."
"The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample ."
"Well . I hope there won't be such things ."
"I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods . "
"You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?"
"Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired ."
"I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job ."
"I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !"
"You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices ."
"That's right , I have to work . "
"Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ?"
"Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !"
"Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things ."
"Fine ! What do you need ?"
"OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives ."
"Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost !"
"Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles ."
"Is that all , your majesty ?"
"Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . "
"Hello , who's that speaking ?"
"I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ?"
"Yes , I do ."
"Is there any furniture in it ?"
"Yes , it's fully furnished ."
"What's the rent for a year ?"
"15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas ."
"Where is it located ?"
"It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station ."
"That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ?"
"The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?"
"OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there ."
"All right , see you . "
"Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days ."
"That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?"
"Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off ."
"That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?"
"The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on ."
"Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave ."
"Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients ."
"Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed ."
"I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . "
"We need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on ."
"Why ?"
"Well , I think we could be saving more ."
"Really , well , o . k . Get the receipts out ."
"Let ’ s see . We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month ."
"That ’ s $ 1825 ."
"We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account ."
"$ 3075 . Our paychecks our $ 3300 , combined . That means we don ’ t have any receipts for $ 225 ."
"Right . "
"This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ?"
"I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us ."
"Don't worry . These dates are only targets . "
"Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ?"
"I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ?"
"Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good ."
"What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new !"
"Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died ."
"Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?"
"I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks ."
"What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! "
"Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ?"
"Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please ."
"Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?"
"This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries ."
"And what is it regarding please ?"
"We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr.Chen will know why I'm calling ."
"Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . "
"Hello . Can I speak to Anne ?"
"Who ’ s calling ?"
"It ’ s Mike , her boyfriend ."
"Hold on , I ’ ll get her ."
"Thanks a lot . "
"Hello , Sunshine Travel Agency ."
"Hello . Is there a package tour to Beijing ?"
"Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places ."
"Does the tour have a Chinese-speaking guide ?"
"Yes , sir ."
"What is the cost of the tour ?"
"Five hundred dollars altogether ."
"It's a bit expensive . Can you tell me the schedule ?"
"Yes , I will introduce the itinerary in detail . "
"Well , do you have any experience in guiding ?"
"Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest ."
"What places of interest did you show them ?"
"Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . "
"do you like music ?"
"well , it depends ."
"do you think this music is warm matched ?"
"of course yes ."
"how about the lyrics ?"
"very touching ."
"it bring me back to some of my childhood memories ."
"yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting ."
"of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance ."
"it is full of energy ."
"this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying ."
"it certainly is . "
"Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit ."
"All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession ."
"Have you received any other honors ?"
"Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 ."
"Do you have anything published ?"
"Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Youth Writer's Collection . "
"How often are stockholders meetings held ?"
"Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year ."
"What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... , You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings ."
"So , how much say do the stockholders really have ?"
"Unless they're united , very little ... "
"Where is it ?"
"I'm going to the Golden hotel ."
"Get in , please ."
"Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10 , Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please ."
"Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please . "
"Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ?"
"Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display ."
"Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive ."
"Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse ."
"What about the outer packing ?"
"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton ."
"Cartons ?"
"Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes ."
"Could you use wooden cases instead ?"
"Why use wooden cases ?"
"I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load ."
"The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting ."
"Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined ."
"No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care ."
"Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage ."
"Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage ."
"Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage ."
"But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D ."
"If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons ."
"I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap ."
"I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much ."
"We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery ."
"Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter ."
"Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . "
"Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ?"
"Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . "
"Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland ."
"Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !"
"Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing ."
"All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !"
"Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous ."
"Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot ."
"It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it ."
"Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! "
"Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave ."
"Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them ."
"That ’ s my job , sir . Just one more signature here , please ."
"There you are . "
"Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ?"
"I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult ."
"How so ?"
"Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved ."
"We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry ."
"Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China ."
"10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country ."
"I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ?"
"I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting ."
"I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . "
"Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ?"
"Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ?"
"Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared ."
"Myrdal , purse don ’ t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ?"
"I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog ."
"OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . "
"Why do you choose our company to apply for a job ?"
"I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . And your company meets all my requirements ."
"Have you got a clear idea about our company ?"
"Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance ."
"Have you tried other companies ?"
"Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company ."
"Will you take a job which is not in line with your major ?"
"Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me ."
"How long would you work here if you were admitted ?"
"I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well ."
"Do you expect a high salary ?"
"In my mind , salary is not the most important thing . "
"Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded ."
"Sure . Where are you ?"
"I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 ."
"What kind of car ?"
"It's a blue Nissan minivan ."
"Where are you going to ?"
"The closest garage . What's the charge ?"
"You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate ."
"How long will it take ?"
"About 20 to 30 minutes ."
"Thanks . "
"I just called Mr . Smith in Room 201 , but there was no reply . Would you find out if he's still staying there ?"
"All right . One moment , please ... No , Mr . Smith checked out this morning ."
"Oh , he did ? May I have his forwarding address , please ?"
"I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one . "
"Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ?"
"That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you ."
"Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?"
"Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ?"
"Dreadful . There , the door is open now ."
"Thank you . "
"How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ?"
"Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you ."
"OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can ."
"Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation ."
"Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms ."
"I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts ."
"But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially ."
"Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability ."
"In what way can we solve the problem ?"
"Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ?"
"Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks ."
"So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months ."
"Well , we accept your suggestion . "
"Good morning madam . What can I get you ?"
"I ’ d like a coffee please ."
"Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ?"
"What have you got ?"
"Well we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte or Americano ."
"Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please ."
"Here you are . You ’ ll find the sugar just over there . "
"Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?"
"Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this ."
"No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ?"
"Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry ."
"There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now ."
"Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ?"
"No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . "
"Hello , this is my passport ."
"What's in your bags ?"
"Those are something gifts I bought for my friends ."
"Would you mind opening it ?"
"Of course not . "
"Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline ."
"Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight ."
"Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite ."
"I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please !"
"Gee ! You are really strong-willed ."
"You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong ."
"Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . "
"Hello , Sir . What can I do for you today ?"
"I need to find a new way of getting my insurance ."
"We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link ."
"Could you give me some details about that ?"
"Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company ."
"That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them !"
"There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit ."
"I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . "
"Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ?"
"Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton ."
"That's a high price ."
"But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year ."
"I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial ."
"OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . "
"Can I get you something to drink ?"
"Sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order ."
"So how about an aperitif ?"
"It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare ."
"Stirred or shaken ?"
"Stirred will be fine ."
"Here you are ."
"Thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ?"
"Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail ."
"Can you recommend one ?"
"Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice ."
"It sounds interesting . I'll take one ."
"Here we go ."
"It tastes great ."
"Enjoy yourself ."
"Yeah . "
"Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ?"
"I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ?"
"Let me check . It's 3.80 m ."
"Are you sure that's high enough ?"
"That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . "

"Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ?"
"Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you ."
"No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job ."
"Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ?"
"OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology ."
"Could you tell me about your work experience ?"
"Of course . I ’ Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation . I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on ."
"Do you enjoy your work ?"
"To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work ."
"Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain ."
"Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility ."
"Good . Go on , please ."
"She must be an honest person ."
"Anything else ?"
"She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative ."
"Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ?"
"Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . "
"I need a room for a few days ."
"That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ?"
"John Sandals . That's S A N D A L S ."

"The price will be $ 308 a night ."
"$ 308 ! That's not bad ."
"Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ?"
"Nonsmoking , definitely !"
"Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ?"
"Yes , that'll be just fine ."
"One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number ."
"It's 626-555-1739 ."
"Let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . Okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in April ! "

"Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ?"
"The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period ."
"So , it's going to cost me then ?"
"I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part . "
"I ’ m ready to settle the bill ."
"I hope you enjoyed your stay ."
"Definitely ! Very relaxing ."
"Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 ."
"What ? I only stayed three nights ."
"That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 ."
"But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive ."
"Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price ."
"But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 ."
"I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night ."
"Perhaps I could talk to your manager ?"
"Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . "
"So , where can I start my work ?"

"Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ?"
"Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it ."
"Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card ."
"Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month ."
"You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month ."
"Really ?"
"Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment ."
"So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ?"
"Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly ."
"How so ?"
"For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops ."
"Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . "
"That'll be eight dollars , please ."
"Here's ten . Keep the change . "

"I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?"
"Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good ."
"O . K ."
"Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?"
"Yes ."
"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit ."
"I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit ."
"Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave ."
"O . K ."
"thanks , doctor . "

"Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . "
"Good morning , what can I do for you ?"
"I want to buy a car to facilitate my life . But I don't have enough money . Could you supply a loan to me ?"
"Oh , I see . Would you mind telling me your monthly salary ?"
"Sure . 7,000 yuan per month ."
"OK . We can supply you a loan . How much do you want to loan ?"
"200,000 yuan . By the way , what about the interest rate ?"
"It's only 4.5 % for one-year loan . Do you want to apply now ?"
"Yes , I think so ."
"OK . Please fill out this loan application ."
"All right . Thank you ."
"My pleasure . "
"Good morning . My name's Jason Smith ."
"Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down ."
"Thank you very much ."
"Now , have you brought your curriculum vitae with you ?"
"Oh , my CV . Yes , here it s . There are three copies ."
"Have you brought your certificates as well ?"
"No , I haven't . I'm awfully sorry . Can I send them to you ?"
"Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience ."
"I haven't been involved in international business , so I don't have any experiences , but I am diligent and I learn very fast ."
"OK , so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?"
"Yes , in most circumstances.Are you available for business travel ?"
"Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently ."

"Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . "
"Do you speak a foreign language ?"
"Yes . I am capable of speaking English smoothly . I have been learning English for years ."
"How well do you know English ?"
"I have no trouble communicating with native English Speaker . I even taught spoken English in a training school . "
"If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ?"
"Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me ."

"How do you plan to accomplish this ?"
"By doing whatever is necessary . "
"What are in this folder ?"
"They are reports of our company ."
"Are they filed alphabetically ?"
"No , they are filed according to dates ."
"Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?"
"No problem , here you are . "
"And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project ."
"I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline ."
"Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks ."
"No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... , I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! "
"Welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ?"
"I hope you can help me . I've been told about something called ' Financing Link ' ?"
"Yes , that is our Personal Wealth Management Service ."
"Could you tell me more ?"
"Of course . Financing Link is a value-added service , and can be tailored to suit your requirements ."
"So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ?"
"Certainly . We can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . That's why this service is so popular ; it's suitable for everyone because we make it that way ."

"Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ?"
"I didn ’ t have any change ."
"Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then ."
"I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why . "
"Good afternoon , how can I be of service today ?"
"My company wants to become involved in your Comprehensive Credit Granting . We are a very young company and I'm not at all sure if we meet your credit requirements ."
"It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you ."
"That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help . "
"You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ?"
"To be honest , I haven't really done much research ."
"I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir ."
"Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice ."
"Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . "
"Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , the PR Director ?"

"I am calling to inquire about the position of PR manager . What requirements does the job need ?"
"The requirements are strong communicational skills , management and work assiduously . And you have to handle the recurring crisis good-humoredly and discreetly . "
"Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out ."
"Where are you ?"
"I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card ."
"Ok . "
"Is Alice available ?"
"You're talking to her ."
"I've called you a hundred times today ."
"I was busy doing something . I apologize ."
"No problem ."
"Did you need something ?"
"Did you want to do something tomorrow ?"
"Is there somewhere special you wanted to go ?"
"How about a movie ?"
"A movie sounds good ."
"Call me tomorrow then ."
"I will see you tomorrow . "
"That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles ."
"Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ?"
"20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery ."
"Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time ."
"Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months ."
"Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ?"
"All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you ."
"Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ?"
"Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra ."
"That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this ."
"Thanks . "
"Please bring your baggage here for inspection ."
"Here you are , officer ."
"Is all your baggage here ?"
"Yes , a camera bag , a travel bag and a suitcase ."
"Have you got anything to declare ?"
"No . I have only personal effects . "
"Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ?"
"Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have ."
"How's Mrs Zu doing these days ?"
"She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see ."
"Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... , I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please ."
"Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do ."
"Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house ."
"Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . "
"What can I help you with today ?"
"I have a problem ."
"What is the problem ?"
"I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced ."
"Do you have enough money in your account ?"
"I think so ."
"Let me check that for you right now ."
"Okay . Thank you ."
"Apparently there is only $ 57 left in your account ."
"You can ’ t be serious !"
"That ’ s what my records show ."
"I see . Thanks for your help . "

"Not yet , Dad . I am watching Ultraman instead.No , no , Dad . Please . This program is on only once a week ."

"What makes you think that ?"
"It's full of violence and you are so young ."

"Wait . What's the time , honey ?"

"Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !"
"Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things ."
"Fine ! What do you need ?"
"OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s , Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost !"
"Never mind that.Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki.If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles ."
"Is that all , your majesty ?"
"Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . "
"Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment ."
"You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment ."
"Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ?"
"Yes , Mr.Forester ."
"When do you start the payment then ?"
"We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments ."

"What time should I call back ?"
"Around 3:30 . "
"Ok ! I ’ m ready for my driving lesson ! Should I start the car ?"
"Hold on there , Fittipaldi , first let ’ s go over things one more time . Now before you even think of starting the car , make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly . Next check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly ."
"We have been through this a million times ! Let ’ s get going already ! I ’ m ready !"
"Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good !"
"I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on !"
"Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk !"
"Get out of my way ! This is just like playing video games !"
"It ’ s the police ! Pull over !"
"They ’ ll never take me alive ! "
"so , are you enjoying the performance so far ?"
"well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ?"
"I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though ."
"do you know anyone in the play ?"
"actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine ."
"really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?"
"that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great ."
"so you've seen other plays that he's directed ?"
"quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?"
"sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?"
"I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school ."
"what did you do ?"
"I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ?"
"I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much ."
"why not ?"
"I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat ."
"that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . "
"Excuse me , would you please tell me where I can find a telephone ?"
"Over there in the booth ."
"How do you use a public phone ?"
"For a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . Inquiries are free from a public phone . "
"How do I know what forms to fill out for unemployment ?"
"There is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits ."
"How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits ?"
"You can go online to begin the application process ."
"What type of information will I have to provide to the Employment Development Office ?"
"You need to be able to say whom you worked for and when ."
"Will they need anything else from me ?"
"You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance ."
"What should I do after I turn in the application ?"
"You need to be interviewed over the phone . They will set up a time for you . "
"Isn't this fun ?"
"I have no idea what I'm doing ."
"Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it !"
"Whoa ! We're changing partners now ? Where do I go ?"
"Let the men take the lead !"
"Whoa ! Oh , no !"
"Oops ! "
"Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore ."
"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas ."
"Show me some classic high heels , please ."
"Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?"
"Black . Classic ."
"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone ."
"Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe ."
"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable ."
"I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly ."
"What size ?"
"Seven-and-a-half ."
"Here we are . How does it fit ?"
"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo , Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . "
"My wife is sick , so I have to cancel a reservation I made ."
"If you'll just give me your name , phone , and date of visit , I can cancel your reservation ."
"I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234 , April ninth to the fifteenth ."
"Mr . Randolph . Okay , one second , sir , and there you go . Your reservation is now cancelled ."
"I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you ."
"Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . "
"Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ?"
"She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs ."
"What made you think that she wasn't very confident ?"
"Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ?"
"She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ?"
"When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional ."
"You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ?"
"It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture !"
"I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language ."
"On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting ."
"That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then ."
"Don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually ! "
"Yes , ma'am ?"
"How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ?"
"Air mail or surface mail ?"
"Air mail , please ."
"That'll be eighty-five cents ."
"Four stamps , please . How much is that ?"
"Three dollars and forty cents ."
"There you go . "
"Order in the court !"
"I would like to make my plea ."
"What is it ?"
"I would like to plead not guilty ."
"You do realize that all the evidence points to you ?"
"I know . But I did not do it ."
"How do you figure that ?"
"I didn ’ t commit the crime ."
"Do you know who did ?"
"If I tell you who did , will you release me ?"
"I ’ m sure we can work out some kind of deal ."
"I ’ ll tell you all you need to know . "
"Are there any scenic spots nearby ?"
"You can go to ZhongShan Park ."
"Have you ever been there ?"
"Yes . The scenery there is so breathtaking , Really ?"
"Yes , of course . It's really worth visiting . "
"Good , morning ! Can I help you ?"
"Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ?"
"Yes . There are trains at 7 fifty-nine , 9 eighteen , 10 thirty-two and 11 fifty-five ."
"What time does the 7 fifty-nine get to London ?"
"At 9 thirty-six . And the 9 eighteen gets to London at 9 fifty-five , the 10 thirty-two at 11 nine ."

"Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement ."
"Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , please sit down . Coffee ?"
"No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine ."
"Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then ."
"Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market ."
"That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?"
"No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal ."
"Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . "
"What is your corporation website address ?"
"It is ' www . job . com ' , Is there a dot after ' com ' ?"
"No . I can text the address to you if you are not clear about it "
"Excuse me , sir . What can I do for you ?"
"Is dinner served ?"
"Yes , sir ."
"Please give me some chicken ."
"OK . Would you like something to drink in advance ? We have all kinds of sodas , juices , beers and wines ."
"Thank you , you are so thoughtful . I think I could use some beers right now . "
"Why do you change your job and apply for a translator ?"
"This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview ."
"What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ?"
"I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator . "
"What is your greatest strength ?"
"I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time ."

"I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated ."

"I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project ."
"Can you work under pressure ?"
"Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work ."
"What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ?"
"There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy ."
"How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ?"
"I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . "
"I hope the food here is good ."
"Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here ."
"But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star ."
"I think we might not see any ."
"Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ?"
"I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting ."
"I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ?"
"Yes , but I still think it could be better . "
"How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years ."
"yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not ."
"yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot ."
"congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing ."
"thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ?"
"no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival ."
"why is that ?"
"well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life ."
"yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle ."
"that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here ."
"I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around ."
"yeah , I think so . "
"Hi , is this Rich ?"
"Yeah , who ’ s calling ?"
"It ’ s Alex ... Have I got some great news ! We got the Baker account . It ’ s all ours !"
"Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far ! "
"Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there ."
"We'd better see if he is ok ."
"Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?"
"He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing ."
"Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 ."
"Hello ? Yes , someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes , my friend is performing CPR . Ok , thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here , let me help . "

"This is Jim . He is our office assistant . "
"Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me ."
"I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day ."
"It does ’ t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired ."
"Thanks for your understanding ."
"You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . "
"What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board ."
"It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand ."
"I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . "
"Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras ."

"Is it OK to drink alcohol ?"
"Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink . "
"What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ?"
"First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur . "

"Some of them seem to be of the latest style . Now I ’ Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish relations with you ."
"Your desire coincides with ours ."
"Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong , or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies ."
"Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit . Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us ."
"That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry ."
"We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us ."
"So do I . "
"I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job , Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much ."
"I want to know your earliest available entry time ."

There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . "
"Hello , Who's that speaking ?"
"I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it ?"
"Yes , I do ."
"Is there any furniture in it ?"
"Yes , It's fully furnished ."
"What's the rent for a year ?"
"15,000 yuan , including water , but not electricity and gas ."
"Where is it located ?"
"It's in the International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes'walk from the nearest subway station ."
"That's great . But can't you make the rent cheaper , Let's see , 12,000 yuan ?"
"The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?"
"OK . I will be free tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . See you ."
"All right , see you . "
"It is quite important to be a good listener in the interview ."
"Listening carefully can show you understand and respect the speaker ."
"It can show your good attainment as well ."
"Besides , you can pick up some helpful information from the talk ."
"First of all , you should keep proper posture and make eye contact with the speaker with a smile ."
"To show that you have understood what is said , you can nod or ask simple questions at the right time ."
"And your statement should be clear and brief to the point ."
"Never should you interrupt on a unfamiliar topic ."
"Sure , in order not to leave a bad impression on the interviewer ."
"Additionally , don't show any impatience to a repeated topic ."

"Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ?"
"Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ?"
"I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good ."
"Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller ."
"Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either ."
"That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ?"
"Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now ."
"There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend ."
"I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else ."
"How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done ."
"That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help ."
"Don't mention it . "
"Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?"
"No.Why ?"
"Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so ."
"Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day . "
"Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?"
"Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave ."
"Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that ."
"Certainly , work always comes first ."
"But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days ."
"Well , keep a low profile . "
"Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier ."
"Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three ."
"Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before ."
"When will we get one of those ?"
"You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . "
"Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit ."

"Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Young Writer's Collection . "
"Is the view going to be ok ?"
"Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine ."
"I ’ ll do my best ."
"That ’ s the way to go . "
"Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ?"
"Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you ."
"Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ?"
"No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . "
"I need something to eat , please ."
"Tell me what you're hungry for ."
"I feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ."
"Unfortunately , we're out of filet mignon at the moment . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ?"
"Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too ."
"Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?"
"Just the champagne will be fine , thank you ."
"You'll see this charge on your amenities account ."
"That's fine ."
"It won't be long until your food is delivered . I know you'll enjoy it . "
"Good afternoon . What service do you require ?"
"I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please ."
"For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see ."
"No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer ."
"What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ?"
"Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind ."
"Certainly , just fill in this form , please . "
"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?"
"Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher ."
"Oh , what ’ s she like ?"
"She is beautiful ."
"Is she old or young ?"
"She is quite young and her hair is blond ."
"Is she strict ?"
"Not really . Her eyes are blue ."
"Can she speak Chinese ?"
"Not much . She is very tall and slim ."
"David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . "
"This is the menu . What would you like to have ?"
"I don't know what to have . If you don't mind , I'll just leave the choice to you ."
"With pleasure , sir . May I suggest Steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks ? They are popular breakfast among Chinese people ."
"OK . Anything to drink ?"
"Yes , sir . We usually serve soya-bean milk and jellied beancurd . Which one do you prefer , sir ? A , I'll try the soya-bean milk this time ."
"So , that's steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks , and a Soya-bean milk ."
"That's right ."
"Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . "
"Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you ."
"What can I do for you ?"
"I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ?"
"Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese ."
"Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion ."
"Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ?"
"We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other ."
"So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ?"
"We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . "
"Advance Reservations . Can I help you ?"
"Yes , I ’ d like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 4th to the morning of October 10th ."
"Could you tell me your name , sir , please ?"
"Yes , it is Smith . "
"Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ?"
"I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up ."
"Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year ."
"I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?"
"Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good ."
"O . K ."
"Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?"
"Yes ."
"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit ."
"I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit ."
"Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave ."
"O . K ."
"thanks , doctor . "
"Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news ."
"What is it ?"
"Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money !"
"What do you mean ? What happened ?"
"There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago ."
"How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return !"
"I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box ."
"Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! "
"What do you do in your spare times ?"
"I have many hobbies . I like almost all kind of sports , and I also like to listen to classical musics ."
"What sports do you like best ?"
"Football . It's a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and I also enjoying the team spirit of football ."
"Do you like reading books ?"
"Yes . I enjoying reading biographs , especially those of well-known statesmen , militarists and artists , I can learn a lot from their life histories ."
"Who are you favourite authors ?"
"I like the novels of Inches very much , I have reading almost all of them in Chinese translation , I wish i can reading them in the original . "
"When can you give me the final decision ?"
"We'll notify you next Thursday at the latest . Shall I telephone you ?"
"OK ."
"All right . Thank you for coming today ."
"Thank you for your interview with me . "
"Hey , Mary . Dress warmly for today ."
"Why ? It looks like a sunny day ."
"Looks can be deceiving ."
"What do you mean ?"
"It's very windy today ."
"But look , it's so sunny out ."
"Mary , you must be careful . In some parts of America , the day can be - 10 ° C and sunny . "
"Interesting lectures , aren't they ?"
"Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good ."

"Working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm !"
"Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?"
"Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . "

"Hi , this is China Southern Airlines . Is that Miss . Ye ?"
"Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ?"
"I am responsible for verifying your information before you come for the interview . What , uh , position do you want ... uh ... to do ?"
"Pardon ? Your way of articulating is too slow . Would you speak a little faster ?"
"Sorry , I am used to speaking in a slow pace , but I will try to be faster . What position do you want to do ?"
"I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours . "
"Can I help you , madam ?"
"Yes . I'd like to choose a sweater for my son ."
"I see . Do you have any ideas so far ?"
"Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ?"
"Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ?"
"Thirteen ."
"And the height ?"
"About 158cm . He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters ."
"I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers ."
"I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles ."
"How about this one then ?"
"The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while . "
"Excuse me , could you please turn on the air-conditioner , it's so hot here ."
"OK , I will fetch the remote control ."
"Aha , it's cool now . Can I keep the robot ?"
"Yes . Here you are . "
"I ’ m so hungry . Let me have a look at the menu ."
"We can pig out on potato chips and cookies . They are very cheap . "
"How do I make a good impression in the interview ?"
"You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you ."
"Anything else ?"
"Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest ."
"What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time ."
"Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big ."
"I see ."
"Try to be natural , alert and interested ."
"You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much ."
"My pleasure . Good luck to you . "
"Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center ."
"What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set ."
"Well , it was . But the contractor ’ s just told me he ’ s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned ."
"Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ’ s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . "
"How were you getting along with your studies ?"
"Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester ."
"In addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ?"
"Yes , I had taken finance courses in a training school . Compound talents are needed in the society and I must study continually to keep abreast with the times . "
"Excuse me , what's the charge for a picture ?"
"$ 1 . You can get your photos instantly ."
"That's great . Give me the landscape of the Triumphal for the background ."
"No problem . Say ' cheese ' . That's good . Please wait a moment . "
"The tea smells good . What tea is it ?"
"It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province ."
"What's special about it except its pleasant smell ?"
"You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well ."
"They must have some special methods to do this during the process ."
"Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities ."
"Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?"
"Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea ."
"What's the advantage about tea ?"
"There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health ."
"Does that mean the stronger the better ?"
"No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong ."
"Got it . What's the proper time for tea ?"
"It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime ."
"Why ?"
"It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . "
"Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ?"
"Yes , here you go ."
"Will you be checking any bags today ."
"Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces ."
"I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase ."
"What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd !"
"I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big ."
"Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this ."
"Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars ."
"That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! "
"Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions ."
"Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market ."
"That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that ."
"Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look ."
"Sure ."
"These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing , Oh , the packing looks very nice ."
"The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales ."
"Good , what about the export packing ?"
"Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case ."
"Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms ."
"You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing ."
"I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ?"
"Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions ."
"Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei ."
"All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . "
"Not only does it centralise management , it also increases the efficiency of funds . We have testimonials from various companies who are very happy with the service ."
"Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service ."
"You see , nowadays , a lot of companies are concerned about their group account management . As long as your company meets all the requirements of our Group Account Deposit Service , I would fully recommend it ."
"It seems perfect ."
"Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed ."
"Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . "
"Hi . This is a Receptionist Desk . How can I help you ?"
"Yes . I just checked in , but I need to change my room ."

"I ’ m sorry . I ’ ll arrange a non-smoking room for you right away . The doorman is going to help you with your luggage . I do apologize for the inconvenience ."
"That ’ s ok . Thanks . "

"Yes . What can I do for you ?"

"I said I am informing you of the interview . "
"I'd like a facial ."
"Which kind would you like ? We have five different varieties of facials ."
"Which would you recommend ?"
"Well , since it's summer , and I had looked that you had quite a bit sun , I'll recommend our summer special , it's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin ."

"Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software ."
"What's the hardware ?"
"The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes ."
"That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ?"
"The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things ."
"I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software ."
"Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus ."
"Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . "
"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please ."
"Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm ."
"How long does it take to get there ?"
"About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive ."
"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !"
"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers ."
"Great ! I ’ ll take it ."

"Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ’ am . "
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ?"
"Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ?"
"Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time ."
"I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures ."
"So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?"
"Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ?"
"I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion , Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . "
"Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company ."
"Hi , Jimmy , good morning ."
"I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person ."
"I see ."
"We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences ."
"Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel ."
"We surely believe you ."
"Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ?"
"I am afraid we are sticking to our choice ."
"Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know ."
"OK . "
"How do you want to advertise the opening ?"
"I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads ."
"All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday ."
"OK . Monday is the big day for job ads ."
"And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday ."
"Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites ."
"Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . "

"Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression , But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes ."
"In the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile ."

"she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand ."
"is there someone else I can talk to ?"
"she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ?"
"any time after 2 pm today would be good for me ."
"Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ?"

"I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ?"

"Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that ."
"Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . "
"We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet ."
"How much would you like ?"
"10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity ."
"A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time ."
"The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business ."
"Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . "
"Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ?"
"Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again ."
"I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign ."
"As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ? "
"Excuse me . Are these chips on sale ?"

"Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ?"

"I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that ."

"I ’ m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ’ t remember that . "
"Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ?"

"When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time ."
"Why did you leave your last position ?"
"I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation . I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance . My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture ."
"What are your salary expectations ?"
"I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later ."
"Do you have any questions ?"
"Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ? "
"What are you doing , Steven ?"
"I'm going to Beijing tomorrow . I'm packing my luggage ."
"What will you bring along when traveling ?"
"I will take some clothes to change and cleaning items ."
"Have you packed the camera yet ?"
"Yes . I've already put it in my suitcase ."
"Pack some necessary medicine in your carry-on ."
"I almost forget it . Thank you ! "
"Here's our sample room ."
"You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here ."
"Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ?"
"I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ?"
"Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require ."
"The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better ."
"You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality ."
"Oh , it's delicious ... "
"Hi , boss . You wanted to see me ?"
"Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't ."
"Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard ."
"I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich ."
"You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? "
"How often do you use the internet ?"
"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?"
"Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor ."
"So , you ’ re online eight hours a day ."
"Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online ."
"How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?"
"I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it ."
"How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?"
"What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . "
"I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview ."
"That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ?"
"I'm not sure of that . Do you know ?"
"I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc ."
"Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth ."
"I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job ."
"So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work ."
"Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person ."
"You are very nice to tell me those ."
"I wish you good luck !"
"Thank you ! "
"Can you effect shipment during September ?"
"I don't think we can make it ."
"Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ?"
"By the middle of October ."
"It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season ."
"Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery ."
"Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ?"
"Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do ."
"Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . "
"What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ?"

"I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ?"
"So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ?"
"Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary . "
"Hello !"
"Is Petti there ?"
"I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here ."
"Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there ."
"I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years ."
"That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ?"
"No , It isn't . It's 736-4565 . It seems you've misdialed ."
"Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again ."
"That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone ."
"Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you ."
"No worries . "

"Here you are . "

"Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff ."
"I see . And how about the working hours ?"
"Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times ."
"Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me ."
"Good , as long as you understand that ."
"And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?"
"Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month ."
"That sounds ideal . "
"First National Bank ."

"When can I go to see him ?"

"OK . "
"Hi , sir . Could you tell me where the Hilton Hotel is ?"
"Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ?"
"Eh , let me see . Sorry , I can't remember it , because I've been there only once , accompanied by my friends ."
"Then , it would be a little bit harder to find out your way . Do you remember the name of the street , or one or two landmarks ?"
"A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo ."
"Good , any other clues ?"
"I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . I waited for the traffic light for a very long time ."
"Oh , is there a bank near there , Standard Charted possibly ?"
"Oh , yeah , I got it , there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there ."
"That's the second branch hotel of Hilton . Walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . Turn left , I believe , you will get it ."
"Great ! Many thanks ! "
"Hi , can I help you ?"
"No , thanks . I'm just looking ."
"All right . If you need any help , just let me know . My name is Greg ."
"Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it ."
"Did you find something you like ?"
"Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ’ m now sleeping on is saggy ."
"You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty , so you don't have to worry about its quality ."
"Does it come with a frame ?"
"Unfortunately , it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June ."
"That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it . "
"Oh ! My mouth is on fire !"
"I feel so good . That warm hot pot certainly hits the spot on winter nights ."
"I need more water !"
"Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place ."
"It's your fault for mixing the two broths !"
"You're going to have a little Montezuma's revenge tomorrow morning . "

"Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?"
"Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision ."
"Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you ."
"Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign ."
"Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !"
"Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times ."
"Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription ."
"Thanks doc !"
"Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . "
"Hello , who is speaking , please ?"
"Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency . I have made the plane reservations for you ."
"Oh , good . Let me get a pencil and take down the information . Well , go ahead , please ."
"Okay . You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines , flight number 222 ."
"What time does it leave ?"
"It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 ."
"That is good ."
"You want to fly first class . Is that correct , Mr . Stern ?"
"That's right ."
"Well , I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats . Your seat numbers are 8A , 8B and 8C ."
"Those are in the non-smoking section , aren't they ?"
"Yes , they are . I have charged the tickets to your credit card . They are 630 dollars each , so It is 1890 dollars for all three ."
"Fine , thank you very much ."
"One more thing . Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with ?"
"Sure . They are my kids , Alex and Kathy Stern ."
"All right . You're all set . Have a nice flight ."
"Thanks . "
"It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods ."
"And that is ?"
"How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ?"
"I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question ."
"It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier ."
"I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ?"
"Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date ."
"Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York ."
"It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ?"
"We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . "
"Would you show me some table-cloths ?"
"Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) , How much is it ?"
"A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan ."
"That ’ s reasonable ."
"If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years ."
"Really ? I ’ ll take it then . "
"I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice ."
"With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ?"
"My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends ."
"Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ?"
"Does that make any difference ?"
"Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike ."
"Are they designed differently ?"
"A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . "
"Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company ."
"Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later ."
"Thank you ."
"Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things ."
"For wood or for metal ?"
"For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ?"
"Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ?"
"Yes , quite free until noon ."
"Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside ."
"Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long ."
"Take your time , sir . I can wait . "
"Shit , so crowded !"
"The radio said it's OK on this road ."
"Things change every minute ."
"We have too many cars ! "
"I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed ."
"OK , do you want us to use starch ?"
"Yes , heavy starch in the collar please ."
"Yeah , sir . Your shirt will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ?"
"I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent ."
"No problem , sir ."
"Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ?"
"We'll remain open from 9 a . m . till 8 p . m ."
"I see ."
"Here's your laundry ticket , sir ."
"Thank you . "
"We're going to have to postpone the meeting ."
"Why ?"
"Mr . Chen can't make it today . "
"Can you recognize Mike's father in the crowd ?"
"Yes , he's holding a bunch of books ."
"Let's run up and give him a hand . "
"How was your flight from Hong Kong ?"
"Okay . What time is the meeting tomorrow ?"
"10:30 . I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10:00 . : 10:30 . "
"Pardon me . Please speak a little louder ."
"I said please stop by the entrance of EVA Air at the Arrival Terminal ."
"Sure . What else can I do for you ?"

"Thanks a lot . We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport . "
"Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something ."
"Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ?"
"Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . ."
"You wanna take some time off , is that right ?"
"Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year ."
"What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence ."
"I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ?"
"Well , I guess so . "
"how can I help you ?"
"I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend ."
"do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?"
"she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance ."
"ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes ."
"which one would you recommend ?"
"personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?"
"that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please ."
"would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers ."
"it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy ."
"how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick ."
"she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big ."
"how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger ."
"no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is ."
"I know what she would like---some whitening cream ."
"no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter ."
"will that be all then ?"
"that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks . "
"What's wrong , Lisa ? You keep pacing back and forth ."
"I'm nervous . I have to make a big presentation in the meeting ."
"Don't worry . You'll do fine . "
"What are your plans for the future if you are hired ?"
"I'll do my utmost if I am hired ."
"Do you have any short-term goals ?"
"No , that thought doesn't cross my mind . "
"Would you like me to go into a little more detail about the free services we can offer you ?"
"Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff ."
"No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ... , Forex registration ?"
"Yes , ' Foreign Exchange Registration ' , for Bank Drafts , Bills of Exchange and so on . Also , approval of RIB accounts , capital verification and so on . "
"Excuse me . I'm looking for Bluemingdails . Could you tell me how to get there ?"
"Sure . It's very close actually.You go straight down this road . Then you turn left , at the next junction ."
"Left the next junction . Ok ."
"Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . You see it as you turn left.Seriously , You can't miss it.It ' s enormous ."

"I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process ."
"As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ?"
"I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ."
"We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ."
"That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me ."
"The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one ."
"When will we know if they accept the offer ?"
"The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days ."

"Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ?"
"Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace ."
"His residence ? You mean the whole palace ?"
"Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family ."
"Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious ."
"Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor ."
"OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic ."
"Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living ."
"I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ?"
"Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power ."
"Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ?"
