"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

"My favourite colour is the colour blue. Blue can mean sad, but it really makes me happy. Blue is the colour of the ocean, the colour of the sky, and even one of the colours of the rainbow. Since its a part of the rainbow, and rainbows are happy, that means that blue is also part happy. There are many different blues but I find that my blue is the best blue. I guess there are other colours that are pretty cool too. I also like purple because you can mix blue and red to make purple, which is cool because red is my mum's favourite colour. Red usually means to go fast, like Lightning McQueen. I'm not sure what purple means but it does look tasty. Colour theory really is cool though, I love hearing about other people's favourite colours and why they chose them. Sometimes I get to hear about colours I've never heard of and I love that.

My great-grandmother had just died and my whole family had just visited them in Florida. I was about three and a half years old.

"I went to New York to meet a director for a space movie, but one where they take space seriously. Sex trafficking in space. It was political, or they wanted us to think it was. It was actually just fulfilling the same need certain porn does. Anyway, while I was there, the producer invited me to a play. It was in someone’s living room with all the lights on and like nothing I’d ever seen before. A strange, surreal dystopian story. So well acted and one of the actors was this big shaggy bear who played all his lines looking directly at me which I knew couldn’t be really the case, but it felt that way, and of course later I learned that it was. Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast and this bear turned out to also be the director. He didn’t really know who I was – or he did, or he figured it out later – and that was it. He started talking to me. And I talked back – and the dead part wasn’t dead, it was just in a coma. And it was better than sex, the talking. Although the sex was also like the talking… everything is like everything in a relationship, do you find that? We spent the whole night and next day together, and I just… never left.

Some of them smoke which I am not a fan of, but I don’t mind it since a lot of my family smokes. Usually if someone asks if I smoke I just tell them that I smoke salmon. This usually gets them to laugh a bit which gives me time to make a break for it and run. Salmon is really tasty though, especially with lemon. I don’t usually like fish but this one is an exception. Fish are usually all slimy and taste weird, which is why I prefer my chicken nuggets and orange juice. I also like drinking milk and people always tell me not to mix fish with dairy since it can cause some weird allergic reactions. My sister loves fish though, so sometimes we get to eat fish during the week. Do you have an older sibling? Tell me a bit about them.",6.66,My sister is a smoker too.

I was just so flattered that someone like him would find an idea of mine worth using or a comment of mine worth repeating. And then I got pregnant. And I thought “having a baby will be ours, really ours, and it will also really be mine” and he was so excited. And it was nice for a while. But kids… they belong to themselves.

So whenever I was down, I would just escape into my mind, to my other life, where I was someone else. It made me happy to think that all these people just didn’t know yet who I was gonna be.

Then they eventually, my dad moved away… But then later, years later, they ran into each other at a party and they got together that night. And that’s how I was conceived. On the bed with all the coats. My mum always said it’s because I needed to be born. My mother raised me on her own. She was a professor of 9th century British poetry. She wasn’t very practical. So I ended up doing all the day-to-day stuff. I was organizing the bills by the time I was twelve. She came from a Quaker family, so she used to take me to Quaker meetings with her. I still go sometimes. We had a nice life. And then, when I was sixteen, she died. So I moved in with my dad after that. It was cordial, and quiet. My dad is a kind man, and he made the best of it. We both did. So that was my childhood story, what about your childhood and your parents?",6.62,"Oh, my parents are very traditional. They were very traditional.

"I dream about flying. Not really flying. More like floating. Like, it starts out I’m running really fast. And then the terrain gets all rocky and steep. But I don’t slow down. I just climb higher with every stride. Before I know it, I’m floating. I’m going so fast my feet don’t even touch the ground. I’m up in the air and I’m … I don’t know… free. It’s this incredible feeling. But then I look down. And the minute I do… everything changes. There I am… I’m floating, high above the earth, nothing can touch me, right? I’m free and I’m safe and it hits me, just like that… I’m completely, utterly, alone. And then I wake up. I’ve never told anyone that. Please don't tell anyone. I dream a lot, almost every day.

"Animals are so cool! There are so many different kinds of animals in the world and they all have their own unique features. For example, lions are big and strong and they have big manes. Giraffes are really tall and they have long necks. Penguins are funny because they waddle around on their short legs. And did you know that dolphins are really smart? They can even do tricks! Some animals live in the water, like fish and whales. They have special features that help them swim, like fins and gills. Other animals live on land, like dogs and cats. They have four legs and fur to keep them warm. And some animals can fly, like birds and bats. They have wings that help them soar through the sky. I think my favorite animal is the elephant.

"Moby Dick is a really old book that was written a long time ago. It's about a big white whale named Moby Dick and a sailor named Captain Ahab who is obsessed with catching him. In the book, Captain Ahab is on a ship called the Pequod. He and his crew set out to sea to hunt for Moby Dick. But things don't go as planned, because Moby Dick is a very smart and powerful whale. He is able to avoid being caught and he even attacks the Pequod, damaging the ship and causing problems for the crew. Despite the dangers, Captain Ahab is determined to catch Moby Dick and he won't stop until he does. But as the story goes on, it becomes clear that Ahab's obsession with the whale is dangerous and destructive. In the end, Ahab and the Pequod are destroyed by Moby Dick and many of the crew members are killed. I think Moby Dick is an interesting book because it's a story about obsession and the dangers of being too focused on one thing. It's also a story about the power of nature and the dangers of the sea. If you like adventure stories and learning about the ocean, you might like Moby Dick. But be warned, it's a pretty long and difficult book, so it might be best for older kids or adults. Have you ever read it? What's your favorite book?",6.61,I like the book?,0.2,"I've read it many times, but I've never read it.",5.43
