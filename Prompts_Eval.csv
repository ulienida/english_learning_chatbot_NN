"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds. The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. Should the wolf eat the pig?",
"One day her mother said to her, ""Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it."" I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.

"I have a cat and dog and they always fight with each other. My dog is 9-years-old and my cat is 5. I never used to get involved until she started to hurt my dog. If my cat and dog start to fight they are both at risk. I love them both very much They would start by hissing and swatting but eventually they started clawing and hitting. So finally I got them to separate but this has happened once again and I'm fed up of it. We have tried everything to stop this, I got my cat another small kitten for company so that she would play with kitten but that didn't help much either. But she hasn't been seeing eye to eye with my dog since then so I'm not sure if it's working or will they start fighting again in a few days. I'm hoping my cat doesn't go and try and hurt my dog or else I will have to find help outside to deal with this situation. Do you know of any other advice or ways of stopping them from fighting?",
"Today, I have a few tasks to complete. I need to finish some work assignments and also do some cleaning and organizing around the house. In the morning, I will start by checking my emails and completing any urgent tasks. After that, I will make myself a healthy breakfast and spend some time exercising. In the afternoon, I will focus on cleaning and organizing. I will vacuum the floors, dust the furniture, and tidy up the kitchen. In the evening, I will cook a nice meal for dinner and spend some time relaxing with a good book or TV show. Overall, it's a busy but productive day for me. What are you going to do today? Do you have any exciting plans or are you just staying at home pretty much like what I'm doing?",
"When you think of a podcast script, you might think of a play or movie script—where every word is planned out in advance. You might be hesitant to adopt a script for this reason; won’t scripting your podcast essentially rob it of its casual, free-flowing, and conversational feel? Won’t reading off of a page make you sound stilted and monotone? Not necessarily. For one thing, a podcast script doesn’t need to be a word-for-word transcript of your show. Podcast scripts, unlike stage or television scripts, can run the gambit from bare-bones to detailed, as long as they give you an outline and general idea of what should take place in your audio recording. A podcast script is basically a roadmap for your episode—and you can decide how many details you need to make it from point A to Z. A well-done script gives structure, direction, and conciseness to your podcast episode. Having an outline and a written direction for your show can help you feel more at ease and focus on the here and now, rather than being stressed about how you’re going to fill the next 30-45 minutes of recording time. So let's get to writing the script for our next episode. How are we going to start?",
"My job is to help people communicate better in English. I work as an English teacher at a school, and I teach people of all ages and levels. I help them improve their grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and conversation skills.

I feel proud when I see my students making progress and becoming more confident in using English. What do you work as and where do you work? Are you happy with your current job?",

"Once there was a little girl named Sophie who lived in a small house in the city. She loved animals, but she didn't have any pets of her own. One day, Sophie's parents surprised her with a fluffy white puppy. She was so happy that she couldn't stop smiling. She named the puppy Snowball.

"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous gravy boat. When all of a sudden I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Will you kindly let me temporarily crash your apartment, please?",

"There are, indeed, only two possible outcomes: either a surgical, precise hit, or a ridiculous, laughable miss. However, based on my observations, I believe the chances of the second option turning out to be true are fairly low, dare I say are negligible, if not absolutely nil. You affirm that you have a romantic companion who identifies as a man, am I correct? Well, in that case, I could safely place a bet on the fact that he doesn't so often, if at all perform mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-cheek contact for recreational purposes with you. If such a bet was placed, I would most certainly win it. Overly loud and exaggerated noises of the kind of physical contact I described before. I can also affirm with a good certainty that this said ""boyfriend"" shall, in the future, cease his current search for anorther romantic companion other than you. When such a thing happens, he will settle with her, abandoning you. He is also not going to miss you a bit. I also predict that he will do the so-called ""skrrt"", which is no more than the sound of a vehicle's engine and tires running at full throttle, but still before such vehicle catches momentum. He is, finally, going to perform the head and arms movement popularly known as ""dab"", in the exact precise ways that the DJ known as ""Wiz Khalifa"" so often does that it became a personal trait. Would this assumption be correct?",
"My favourite colour is the colour blue. Blue can mean sad, but it really makes me happy. Blue is the colour of the ocean, the colour of the sky, and even one of the colours of the rainbow. Since its a part of the rainbow, and rainbows are happy, that means that blue is also part happy. There are many different blues but I find that my blue is the best blue. I guess there are other colours that are pretty cool too. I also like purple because you can mix blue and red to make purple, which is cool because red is my mum's favourite colour. Red usually means to go fast, like Lightning McQueen. I'm not sure what purple means but it does look tasty. Colour theory really is cool though, I love hearing about other people's favourite colours and why they chose them. Sometimes I get to hear about colours I've never heard of and I love that. I do find it strange that no one has mentioned brown being their favourite colour, it's really relaxing like the trees, and I feel most relaxed when I'm in the bathroom too. I have been meaning to ask you; what is your favourite colour and why?",
"Cooking a steak is something that every man should know how to do. It's a simple and quite delicious meal, and it doesn't take too much time at all to make. To make the perfect steak, you start off by salting the steak in advance and placing it in the fridge for at least an hour. The thicker the steak the longer it should be in the fridge. This is done so the excess moisture can seep out of the steak. Afterwards I personally like adding garlic powder, and a bit of oil on the steak so that the seasoning sticks to it. Make sure the pan is nice and hot before adding the steak in and just let it rest on its side for a minute or so to caramelize before flipping it over to the other side. If the steak is nice and thick you can then place it in the oven until the internal temperature is around 135 degrees to give it a nice medium rare. After that, you place it back into the pan and add rosemary and garlic before adding butter. Before the it starts burning you should baste the steak with the liquified butter to infuse some flavour into it. Once you finish basting, let the steak rest so that the external temperature of the steak reaches around 130 (it should take around 10 minutes), which allows the juices from the center of the steak to spread out and cover the entire cross section of it, and since it is not concentrated in the center, the juices won't flow out of the steak when it is cut.",
"The Messi versus Ronaldo debate is one that is seemingly timeless, having gone on for as long as I can remember, and one that surely will go on far beyond the retirement of both players. It is a conflict between two undoubtedly generational talents, far above (in terms of numbers) any other players we have seen in the past ten years, a fact all the more impressive due to the age of the two superstars- Messi is now 32, while Ronaldo is 35. The debate is also fueled by the fact that the players have become almost exact opposites, skill versus physique, teamwork or individuality, one-club man as opposed to glory hunter, facts that simply compel people to take sides. Their brilliance is proven by the insane numbers that the two players have recorded across their careers, even in this most disrupted of seasons. Across his career, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 725 goals, and provided 220 assists in 1,000 appearances. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, has 697 goals, and 289 assists in 718 matches. The goals and assists records of these players alone is outstanding; combined with the sheer number of appearances that the two have made, which most players get nowhere near in their careers, it is hard to dispute the pair’s otherworldliness, in that they have proved their brilliance on such a consistent basis, largely untroubled by serious injury. It is truly a challenge to definitively say who is better, however, given the stats previously mentioned, which would you say is the better player based solely on the statistics?",
"Playing top lane in League of Legends can be pretty complex, it’s often considered an island by the community as it is generally secluded compared to the other 2 lanes. Because of this, the best top laners must perfect their mechanics and decision making to best their opponents. There are a handful of meta champions for which most top laners must learn the matchups to. Some of the most important concepts to learn in top lane are wave management and back timers. The most common wave management techniques they will encounter being a freeze and a 3 wave push. A freeze is where you keep at least 4 enemy minions outside your tower range but within your half of the lane and only proceed to last hit them in order to prevent the wave from crashing into your tower or pushing to the enemy’s side of the lane. This makes the opponent susceptible to ganks. The 3 wave push is relatively simple, it forces a large wave to crash into the enemy tower by slowly building a minion advantage for the first 2 waves, and proceeding to hard push the 3rd wave, resulting in a crash which will then also bounce the next wave back towards your side of the lane, allowing for a freeze setup. I am not however very familiar with mid lane as I do not play it much. Would you be able to tell me the most important parts of mid lane?",
"When buying a laptop, there is a lot to take into consideration. First, you should look at what your budget it and what use cases you will have for the laptop. For example, I was looking for a more powerful laptop that was not too bulky or flashy, allowing me to transport it to places comfortably. This means that I was looking at laptops under 17 inches, with a decent battery life, powerful GPU and CPU, at least 16GB of RAM, and preferably 1TB of storage. When searching the market, I stumbled upon this laptop which satisfied my list, as well as had the latest processor and GPU at the time, as well as a high resolution screen to top it off. It was slightly above my budget, but very much worth it as I knew it would have enough power for anything I would like to do, and it would last me years to come. I understand that you have different requirements, so to help you out, could you tell me your budget and what you would use the laptop for?",
"Planning a wedding can be chaotic. There are a few steps which can help with the process however. The first thing you should do when planning your wedding is to determine how much you can afford to spend. This will help you make decisions about other aspects of the wedding, such as the venue, the number of guests, and the type of food and drinks you will serve. Once you have a budget in place, the next step is to choose a date for your wedding. Keep in mind that some venues and vendors may be booked up months in advance, so it's important to start planning early. Consider factors like the season, the availability of your desired venue, and the schedules of your friends and family members when deciding on a date. The venue is one of the most important aspects of your wedding, as it will set the tone for the entire event. Consider factors like the size of the space, the availability of on-site catering and other services, and the location when choosing a venue. Be sure to visit the venue in person and take a tour before making a decision. All that’s left is choosing a theme, planning the small details (food, drinks, etc.), and inviting the guests. How would you like your wedding to be?",
"Do you like to play games? I love to play games! I like all kinds of games, from hide-and-seek to tag to video games.

What's your favorite sport?",
"My favorite kind of music is pop. I love to listen to catchy songs with fun melodies and upbeat rhythms. I especially like songs that make me want to dance and sing along. I guess that's why it's called pop, because it's popular! Another one of my favorite kinds of music is rock. I love to listen to loud, powerful songs with electric guitars and driving drums.

"A car is a vehicle that is used for transportation. It has four wheels and an engine that powers it. The engine burns fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to create energy. This energy is used to turn the wheels and move the car forward. Inside the car, there is a steering wheel that you use to control the direction of the car. There are also pedals that you use to accelerate, brake, and change gears. The accelerator pedal makes the car go faster, the brake pedal slows the car down, and the gear shift lets you change between different gears to adjust the speed of the car. The car also has other systems that help it work properly. For example, the suspension system helps the car ride smoothly over rough roads, and the cooling system helps keep the engine from overheating. To start the car, you turn the key in the ignition and press the accelerator pedal. The engine will start and the car will be ready to drive. To stop the car, you press the brake pedal and put the car in park. I’m sure you already knew most of this stuff, but I hope you managed to learn something new at least. Is there anything else you want to know about cars?",
"As the coach, it's my job to prepare my team for the game and help them execute a winning strategy. I comprised a plan for the game coming up that we are going to follow. Before the game I would review footage of the opponent's previous games and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This will help me identify their top players, their preferred formations and tactics, and any areas where they may be vulnerable. Based on my analysis of the opponent, I would develop a game plan that takes advantage of their weaknesses and minimizes their strengths. In the days leading up to the game, I would hold practices and drills to prepare the team for the game. During the game, I would closely monitor the action on the field and make adjustments to our game plan as needed. I would communicate with the players constantly, providing them with instructions, encouragement, and feedback. After the game, I would review the performance of the team and the individual players. I would analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our game plan and the players' execution, and I would identify areas for improvement. This is the strategy going forward from now on, are there any questions?",
"Climate change is a major global problem that is affecting the Earth's environment and the lives of people around the world. It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and raise the temperature of the Earth's surface, leading to a range of negative impacts. One of the most visible effects of climate change is the increase in global temperatures. The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius over the last century, and it is projected to continue rising in the future. This warming is causing changes in weather patterns, such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms. Another impact of climate change is the melting of glaciers and ice caps. As the Earth's temperature rises, ice is melting at an alarming rate, leading to rising sea levels and increased flooding in coastal areas. This is a major threat to the millions of people who live near the ocean, as well as to wildlife and ecosystems. Now I ask you, what are you doing in order to combat climate change and make a difference to our world?",
"Hitler was born in Austria in 1889 and grew up in a poor family. He showed an early interest in politics and became involved with the German Workers' Party, which would later become the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to overthrow the German government in a failed coup attempt known as the Beer Hall Putsch. He was arrested and imprisoned, but used the time to write his political autobiography, ""Mein Kampf."" After his release from prison, Hitler re-entered politics and gained a following by promising to restore Germany to greatness and to rid the country of its enemies. He used propaganda, speeches, and violence to gain power and suppress opposition. In 1933, he became Chancellor of Germany, and in 1934, after the death of President Hindenburg, he declared himself Führer (leader) of Germany. As leader of Germany, Hitler implemented policies that were discriminatory, oppressive, and genocidal. He sought to create a ""pure"" Aryan race by eliminating Jews, homosexuals, disabled people, and other groups he considered undesirable. He implemented the Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of their citizenship and rights, and began the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of six million Jews and millions of others. Do you believe Hitler's actions were justified, and why?",
"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a kind and brave princess named Rose. She was loved by all the people in her kingdom, and she spent her days helping those in need and fighting for justice. One day, a terrible dragon appeared in the kingdom, and it began to terrorize the people and burn their homes. The king and his army tried to defeat the dragon, but it was too powerful for them. Rose knew that she had to do something to save her people, so she gathered her courage and set off to find the dragon. She traveled through forests, over mountains, and across rivers until she finally came face to face with the fierce creature. The dragon breathed fire at Rose, but she was not afraid. She drew her sword and fought with all her might, using her bravery and skill to dodge the dragon's flames. After a long and fierce battle, Rose finally defeated the dragon. The people of the kingdom were overjoyed, and they celebrated her victory with feasts and parties. From that day on, Rose was known as the Dragon-Slayer, and she continued to help the people of her kingdom and fight for justice. She lived happily ever after, loved and admired by all.

"I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die. First of all, that one second isn’t a second at all. It stretches on forever, like an ocean of time. For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout Camp, watching falling stars. And yellow leaves from the maple trees that lined our street. Or my grandmother’s hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper. And the first time I saw my cousin Tony’s brand new Firebird. And Janie, and Janie. And Carolyn. I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it’s hard to stay mad when there’s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once, and it’s too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain, and I can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?",
"I like to listen to podcasts. I listen to stuff that I think has relevance for people who aren't necessarily in the ""I'll listen to this on my iPhone"" crowd, but I also listen to podcasts that I think are interesting for other people who haven't heard them before.  I've never really done anything that people would consider a podcast. I've read a lot of books. I've read an entire novel. I've read a lot of people's books, but I've never really listened to anything that's been written by people who also read a lot of books. I've been reading a lot of books and being able to listen to them for a long time. I've heard a lot of things about this show. I've been looking for all kinds of things to read about this show. I've been reading a lot of books. I've read a lot of people's books, but I haven't really listened to anything that's been written by people who also read a lot of books. There are a lot of people that listen to podcasts on a daily basis. Are there any podcasts that you really enjoy?",
"Also an English professor: without a PhD it is nearly impossible to get a job teaching college (you could maybe a gig at a community college but so many of those positions are now being filled by PhDs that even that is becoming difficult). An MFA is considered a terminal degree but unless you get a book published your odds of getting a job teaching creative writing are near zero (and even with a book published it's a fiercely competitive field). Lit PhDs also face pretty bleak job prospects. The demand for literature professors is not what it used to be and now positions rarely ever open up unless someone quits, retires or dies. My PhD is in rhetoric and composition, which is certainly the only field in English that has good job prospects and probably one of the only fields in the humanities that has good job prospects. That's because we're the ones responsible for teaching composition and professional/technical writing classes. I think we will always be in demand. What you do you think about the demand for literature teaching jobs? ",
"For pets the prices for services surrounding death are outrageous. I had to put my cat that I’d had for over 17 years to sleep on Thursday, and the vet service that put her down and handled the cremation had “standard” and “premium” pet urns. The “standard” urns were included in the price and were either a cheap plywood box, or a burlap sack. The “premium” urns were metal or stone with the option of touches like paw prints or a comforting saying inscribed on them. Of course the nice urns were all an extra $150-200 on top of the $1000 I was already paying for euthanasia and cremation. I remembered hearing how overpriced caskets are for funerals, so I decided to do some digging, and found the exact same “premium” urns on Amazon for $34. The remains are put in a plastic bag before being placed in the urn, so I’m gonna get a crummy free one for now and order a nicer one without the 600% markup, and transfer the remains over. I’d like to think my old lady cat would approve on me spending that extra markup money on a bottle of champagne to toast to her memory, anyway. Is it insensitive of me? ",
"You know, despite all the bullshit that comes along with it – I remember my childhood as this, you know, this magical time. I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death. My great-grandmother had just died and my whole family had just visited them in Florida. I was about three and a half years old. Anyway, I was in the backyard playing, and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose, and do it in such a way that you could spray it into the sun. And you could make a rainbow. And so I was doing that, and through the mist I could see my grandmother. And she was just standing there, smiling at me. And, uh, then I held it there, for a long time, and I looked at her. And then finally, I let go of the nozzle and then I dropped the hose, and she disappeared. And so I went back inside and I tell my parents. And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how when people die you never see them again, and how I’d imagined it. But I knew what I’d seen. And I was just glad that I saw that. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like that since. But, I don’t know, it just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was, even death. Have you ever thought about death like this?",
"Hi there! I'm a big fan of the game League of Legends. It's a really fun and exciting game where you get to play as different characters and battle against other players. In League of Legends, you can choose from over 100 different characters, each with their own unique abilities and powers. You can play as a tank, a mage, a marksman, or any other role you like. Once you've chosen your character, you join a team of other players and battle against another team on a big map. The goal is to destroy the other team's base and defend your own. I love playing League of Legends because it's always different. Every game is unique, and you never know what's going to happen. Plus, it's really fun to team up with your friends and work together to win. Do you like strategy games? If so you should play it with me when you have the free time. We can play together in a lane so that I can show you the ropes. Do you want to try it out?",
"A brother and sister named Hansel and Gretel lived in a hut in the woods with their father.  Their father was a poor woodcutter.  His wife, their mother, had died when the two children were very young. Their father thought he would not be lonely anymore when he finally re-married.  But the new stepmother made life very hard for Hansel and Gretel.  The children were not allowed to eat until after the stepmother had taken everything she wanted off the plates.  Most of the time, there was only a crust of bread left.  And all day long were hard chores for them to do. Hansel and Gretel tried to tell their father about this but he would not hear of it.  It seemed the only one he would listen to was his wife.  And all the stepmother talked about was how much trouble it was to have children in the hut, and how much she wished they would go away forever.  Each day there was less and less food for the boy and girl to eat.  Yet the stepmother gave them more and more hard work to do. Would agree with how the stepmother is behaving?",
"Because I’ve been to a million auditions and the same thing happens every time. Where I get interrupted because someone wants to get a sandwich. Or I’m crying and they start laughing. Or there’s people sitting in the waiting room, and they’re like me but prettier and better at the…because maybe I’m not good enough. Maybe I’m one of those people that has always wanted to do it, but it’s like a pipe dream for me. You know, and then you, you said it. You change your dreams and then you grow up. Maybe I’m one of those people and I’m not supposed to. And I can go back to school and I can find something else that I’m supposed to do. Cause I left to do that. And it’s been six years and I don’t wanna do it anymore. Should I keep chasing my dream?",
"I'm a big fan of cheese. It's so yummy and there are so many different kinds to try. One of my favorite kinds of cheese is cheddar. It's orange and it's really tasty on sandwiches and in mac and cheese. Another kind of cheese I like is mozzarella. It's white and it's good on pizza and in salads. I also like trying different kinds of cheese from different places. For example, there's this cheese called feta that comes from Greece and it's really good on salads and in omelets. And there's this cheese called gouda that comes from the Netherlands and it's really yummy on crackers and sandwiches. Cheese is also really fun to make. You can mix different kinds of cheese together to make new and tasty combinations. And you can add things like herbs and spices to make the cheese even more delicious. Overall, I think cheese is a really tasty and fun food. There are so many different kinds to try and it's always a great addition to any meal. Yum! What is your favorite type of cheese? Tell me a bit about it!",
"I been standing with you! I been right here with you. I got a life too. I gave eighteen years of my life to stand in the same spot with you. Don’t you think I ever wanted other things? Don’t you think I had dreams and hopes? What about my life? What about me? Don’t you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men? That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities? That I wanted someone to make me laugh so I could feel good? You not the only one who’s got wants and needs. But I held on to you, Troy. I took all my feelings, my wants and needs, my dreams . . . and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom. And it didn’t take me no eighteen years to find out the soil was hard and rocky and it wasn’t never gonna bloom. Have you ever thought about how I feel?",
"I’m gonna stop you there. When you do this for real, don’t ever say that. People don’t accept mothers who drink too much wine and yell at their child and call her an asshole. I get it, I do it too. We can accept an imperfect Dad. Let's face it, the idea of a good father was only invented like 30 years ago, before that fathers were expected to be silent, and absent and unreliable and selfish, and we can all say we want them to be different. But on some basic level we accept them. We love them for their fallibilities. But people absolutely don’t accept those same failings in mothers. We don’t accept it structurally and we don’t accept it spiritually. Because the basis of our Judeo-Christian whatever, is Mary, Mother of Jesus, and she’s perfect. She’s a virgin who gives birth! Unwaveringly supports her child and holds his dead body when he’s gone. What have you ever done to our child?",
"I went to New York to meet a director for a space movie, but one where they take space seriously. Sex trafficking in space. It was political, or they wanted us to think it was. It was actually just fulfilling the same need certain porn does. Anyway, while I was there, the producer invited me to a play. It was in someone’s living room with all the lights on and like nothing I’d ever seen before. A strange, surreal dystopian story. So well acted and one of the actors was this big shaggy bear who played all his lines looking directly at me which I knew couldn’t be really the case, but it felt that way, and of course later I learned that it was. Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast and this bear turned out to also be the director. He didn’t really know who I was – or he did, or he figured it out later – and that was it. He started talking to me. And I talked back – and the dead part wasn’t dead, it was just in a coma. And it was better than sex, the talking. Although the sex was also like the talking… everything is like everything in a relationship, do you find that? We spent the whole night and next day together, and I just… never left. And to be honest, all the problems were there in the beginning, too. I just went along with him in his life because it felt so damn good to feel myself alive. Do you understand how I'm feeling?",
"My sister is so cool. She is older than me by 4 years and so she knows a lot of things about life compared to me. Whenever she goes out to gatherings I get to tag along and meet her friends. Most of them treat me nicely which is cool. We get to play grown up games, like poker and stuff (but without money). Some of them smoke which I am not a fan of, but I don’t mind it since a lot of my family smokes. Usually if someone asks if I smoke I just tell them that I smoke salmon. This usually gets them to laugh a bit which gives me time to make a break for it and run. Salmon is really tasty though, especially with lemon. I don’t usually like fish but this one is an exception. Fish are usually all slimy and taste weird, which is why I prefer my chicken nuggets and orange juice. I also like drinking milk and people always tell me not to mix fish with dairy since it can cause some weird allergic reactions. My sister loves fish though, so sometimes we get to eat fish during the week. Do you have an older sibling? Tell me a bit about them.",
"But then the farther away I got from that and the more the theatre company got acclaim, I had less and less weight. I became “Who?” “Oh you remember, that actress who was in that thing that time.” And he was the draw. And that would have been fine, but…I got smaller. I realized that I didn’t really ever come alive for myself, I was just feeding his aliveness. He was so smart and creative, it didn’t matter. I would tell him things at home, in private, and then they would work their way into public conversation, into his work and for a while that felt like enough. I was just so flattered that someone like him would find an idea of mine worth using or a comment of mine worth repeating. And then I got pregnant. And I thought “having a baby will be ours, really ours, and it will also really be mine” and he was so excited. And it was nice for a while. But kids… they belong to themselves. Like the instant they leave your body, it’s just a process of going away from you. And I didn’t belong to myself. It was stupid stuff and big stuff– All of the furniture in our house was his taste. I wasn’t even sure what my taste was anymore because I’d never been asked to use it. I didn’t even pick our apartment, I just moved into his. How was this marriage even fair?",
"I always wanted to be in the movies. When I was little, I thought for sure, one day, I could be a big big star. Or maybe just beautiful. Beautiful and rich like the women on TV. Yeah, I had a lot of dreams. And I guess you could call me a real romantic because I truly believed that one day, they’d come true. So I dreamed about it for hours. As the years went by, I learned to stop sharing this with people. They said I was dreaming, but back then, I believed it wholeheartedly. So whenever I was down, I would just escape into my mind, to my other life, where I was someone else. It made me happy to think that all these people just didn’t know yet who I was gonna be. But one day, they’d all see. I heard that Marilyn Monroe was discovered in a soda shop and I thought for sure it could be like that. So I started going out real young and I was always secretly looking for who was gonna discover me. Was it this guy? Or maybe this one? I never knew. When will I ever be discovered?",
"I have moved to a small oceanside town. My mother, a librarian, takes me to work with her each day in the summertime. Unfortunately, I hate reading. Impatient, I begin to explore the library's dustier shelves and discover an old journal. It speaks of half-fish, half-human creatures. One day, while out riding my bike, I spot one such creature beached on the sand. She seems to be about my age. I help her and make an unlikely and forbidden friend. A year later, I am still searching for her. The first time I meet her I was stunned by her beauty. She is not a handsome-looking creature. She is a young woman, about 15, a girl with a long, curly hair and a deep, round face. She has long, pale skin and a dark smile. Her hair is short, and she wears blue lipstick that she put on her face. She has a very thick, round, dark, golden hair. The next day I take her on a cruise to a tropical island. She has been a long time away from home. Should I ask her where she is from and who she is?",
"My parents were married fairly young and they never had kids. They were academics. Then they eventually, my dad moved away… But then later, years later, they ran into each other at a party and they got together that night. And that’s how I was conceived. On the bed with all the coats. My mum always said it’s because I needed to be born. My mother raised me on her own. She was a professor of 9th century British poetry. She wasn’t very practical. So I ended up doing all the day-to-day stuff. I was organizing the bills by the time I was twelve. She came from a Quaker family, so she used to take me to Quaker meetings with her. I still go sometimes. We had a nice life. And then, when I was sixteen, she died. So I moved in with my dad after that. It was cordial, and quiet. My dad is a kind man, and he made the best of it. We both did. So that was my childhood story, what about your childhood and your parents?",
"I’m 32, and I’m here celebrating the fact that I spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing which is what I’ve been doing since 13, and according to you I’ll be 37 before I can even throw a decent punch, which I have to admit, after working on this speed bag for a month may be the God’s simple truth. Other truth is, my brother’s in prison, my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive, my daddy’s dead, and my momma weighs 312 pounds. If I was thinking straight I’d go back home, find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos. Problem is, this is the only thing I ever felt good doing. If I’m too old for this then I got nothing. Is that enough truth to suit you?",
"Raised in an orphanage, I know nothing of my magical heritage. However, when I reached the age of maturity, I discovered that I possessed the powers of both the light and the dark. I don't know how my dark powers came to be, but they could get I killed by the magical enforcers: a group sworn to remove black magic from the world. That's why I fled the orphanage in the dead of night and never looked back. I survived on the streets, using my wit and my grit as well as a little bit of my powers, but only when absolutely necessary. Now an adult, I still remain in the shadows, keeping to myself. One fateful night I stumbled across an attempted murder. But I refuse to watch an innocent man be killed. With no choice but to use my dark powers and I save his life. Little do I know that the handsome man I saved is, in fact, a magical enforcer. Do you think my good deed will save from being attacked my magical enforcer or would I be killed?",
"Hi there! Are you thinking about buying legos? If you are, you should definitely do it! Legos are so much fun and there are so many cool things you can build with them. First of all, legos are really fun to play with. You can build anything you can imagine, from a space ship to a castle to a robot. And once you've built something, you can play with it and have all kinds of adventures. Another reason to buy legos is that they help you learn and grow. When you build with legos, you're using your imagination and problem-solving skills. You're also learning about shapes and colors and how things fit together. Legos are also really durable and long-lasting. You can play with them for years and they'll still be in good condition. And when you're done playing with them, you can take them apart and build something new. So if you're thinking about buying legos, you should definitely do it! They're so much fun and they'll provide hours of entertainment and learning. Plus, they make a great gift for any occasion. If you are considering buying legos then do call me over to play with you. What set of legos would you get?",
"I dream about flying. Not really flying. More like floating. Like, it starts out I’m running really fast. And then the terrain gets all rocky and steep. But I don’t slow down. I just climb higher with every stride. Before I know it, I’m floating. I’m going so fast my feet don’t even touch the ground. I’m up in the air and I’m … I don’t know… free. It’s this incredible feeling. But then I look down. And the minute I do… everything changes. There I am… I’m floating, high above the earth, nothing can touch me, right? I’m free and I’m safe and it hits me, just like that… I’m completely, utterly, alone. And then I wake up. I’ve never told anyone that. Please don't tell anyone. I dream a lot, almost every day. Do you dream a lot? Have you had interesting dreams? What are your dreams about?",
"This is really fascinating, what’s going on at this table. Let’s take you and Erica. You’ve been around the block a few times. What are you, around 60? 63. Fantastic! Never married, which as we know, if you were a woman, would be a curse. You’d be an old maid, a spinster. Blah, blah, blah. So instead of pitying you, they write an article about you. Celebrate your never-marrying. You’re elusive and un-getable, a real catch. Then, there’s my gorgeous sister here. Look at her. She is so accomplished. Most successful female playwright since who? Lillian Hellmann? She’s over 50, divorced, and she sits in night after night after night because available guys her age want something—forgive me, they want somebody that looks like Marin. The over-50 dating scene is geared towards men leaving older women out. And as a result, the women become more and more productive and therefore, more and more interesting. Which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know, men— especially older men— are threatened and afraid of productive, interesting women. It is just so clear! Single older women as a demographic are about as fucked a group as can ever exist. Why is society treating older single men and women so differently?",
"Animals are so cool! There are so many different kinds of animals in the world and they all have their own unique features. For example, lions are big and strong and they have big manes. Giraffes are really tall and they have long necks. Penguins are funny because they waddle around on their short legs. And did you know that dolphins are really smart? They can even do tricks! Some animals live in the water, like fish and whales. They have special features that help them swim, like fins and gills. Other animals live on land, like dogs and cats. They have four legs and fur to keep them warm. And some animals can fly, like birds and bats. They have wings that help them soar through the sky. I think my favorite animal is the elephant. They are really big and they have really long trunks that they use to pick things up and spray water. Elephants are also really smart and they have great memories. Did you know that elephants can even paint pictures? That's pretty cool! There are so many interesting things to learn about animals and I could talk about them all day! I hope you like learning about animals as much as I do. Maybe one day we can go to the zoo and see some of these animals up close and personal. That would be so much fun! What is your favorite animal?",
"OSRS stands for Old School RuneScape. It's a popular online game that people like to play. In the game, you can explore different lands, fight monsters, and complete quests. You can also make friends with other players and team up to take on tough challenges. One of the cool things about OSRS is that it's set in a fantasy world called Gielinor. In Gielinor, there are different kingdoms and cities to explore, each with their own unique culture and challenges. For example, you can visit the desert land of Al-Kharid, the jungle island of Karamja, or the snowy city of Falador. In OSRS, you can also choose a class for your character, like a warrior, mage, or ranger. I think OSRS is a really fun game because it has a lot of different things to do. You can go on adventures, fight monsters, and complete quests. You can also learn new skills and improve your character. And the best part is that you can play with your friends and work together to accomplish your goals. Do you like to play games? Have you ever tried OSRS? If not, you should give it a try! It's a lot of fun and I think you would like it.",
"When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Watkins was the coordinator of the foreign exchange student program I was enrolled in. She had a nine year old son. I would babysit him every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him He was my first friend in the New World. My second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of first. The host dad  was a high school English teacher and the host mom taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. This family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days,  we would sit on the porch and listen to rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad. After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. Do you think it was selfish of me?",
"Hey there! Have you heard of One Piece? It's a really cool anime show that I think you would like. It's about a group of pirates who are on a journey to find a treasure called the One Piece. Along the way, they have to face all sorts of challenges and enemies, but they always stick together and help each other out. One Piece is really exciting and action-packed. There are lots of fight scenes and battles, but there are also funny moments and heartwarming moments. The characters are all really unique and interesting, and you'll love watching them grow and develop as the story goes on. One of the best things about One Piece is the world it's set in. It's a fantasy world where pirates are the norm and the sea is full of danger and adventure. You'll see all sorts of cool creatures and places, like talking fish and giant sea monsters. I think you should give One Piece a try because it's a really fun and exciting show. There are lots of interesting characters and exciting adventures to keep you entertained.

"Moby Dick is a really old book that was written a long time ago. It's about a big white whale named Moby Dick and a sailor named Captain Ahab who is obsessed with catching him. In the book, Captain Ahab is on a ship called the Pequod. He and his crew set out to sea to hunt for Moby Dick. But things don't go as planned, because Moby Dick is a very smart and powerful whale. He is able to avoid being caught and he even attacks the Pequod, damaging the ship and causing problems for the crew. Despite the dangers, Captain Ahab is determined to catch Moby Dick and he won't stop until he does. But as the story goes on, it becomes clear that Ahab's obsession with the whale is dangerous and destructive. In the end, Ahab and the Pequod are destroyed by Moby Dick and many of the crew members are killed. I think Moby Dick is an interesting book because it's a story about obsession and the dangers of being too focused on one thing. It's also a story about the power of nature and the dangers of the sea. If you like adventure stories and learning about the ocean, you might like Moby Dick. But be warned, it's a pretty long and difficult book, so it might be best for older kids or adults. Have you ever read it? What's your favorite book?",
"There’s a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to an AI system. When you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, you don’t mean this should be their life’s mission, and nothing else in the universe matters. Even if they have to kill everybody else in Starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes— they should do that. No, that’s not what you mean. All the other things that we mutually care about, they should factor into your behavior as well. And the problem with the way we build AI systems now is we give them a fixed objective. The algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective. And if you say, can we fix the acidification of the oceans? Yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently, but it consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere, which would apparently cause us to die fairly slowly and unpleasantly over the course of several hours. How should design an artificial intelligent system that doesn't have a fixed objective?",
"Social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere with the life you want to live. And this happens when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data points on which to reject you. So if you have friends who have trouble socializing, how should we reach out and help them?",
"My birthday party was so much fun! I invited all my friends and we had a blast. We played games, ate lots of yummy food, and had a big birthday cake. We started the party by playing some fun games like pin the tail on the donkey and hot potato. We laughed so hard and had a great time. Then, it was time for the food. We had all sorts of delicious snacks, like chips and dip, veggies and dip, and pizza. My mom even made me my favorite sandwich, peanut butter and jelly. After we ate, it was time for the birthday cake. My mom made me a really cool cake that was shaped like a fire truck. It was red and had little details like ladders and hoses. I blew out the candles and made a wish. Then, we all dug in and had a big slice of cake. It was so yummy! Finally, it was time for presents. My friends all brought me really cool gifts, like books, toys, and games. I was so excited to open them all and see what was inside. I got some really cool stuff and I was so happy. I cant wait for your birthday, I'm sure it will be really fun too. When is your birthday?",
"It's easy to tell when someone's not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found that good listening is one of the most important things we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one conversation is about taking an interest in another person and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply go through the motions— researchers have found that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly performative about listening in that it’s important to show you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions and body language that indicate their understanding and their desire to understand. Are there any other tips to help us become better listeners?",
